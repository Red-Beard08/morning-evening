<title>Morning and Evening: Daily Readings</title>

<generalInfo>
  <description>Organized by month, this devotional has a morning and 
evening meditation for every day of the year. Although these devotions 
are short in length, they are filled with spiritual goodness. In just a 
few sentences, Spurgeon is able to convey the wisdom of Scripture with 
eloquence and purpose. These daily messages provide Christians with the 
spiritual energy they need to begin and end each day. Spurgeon weaves a 
verse of Scripture into each devotion, helping readers draw deeper 
meaning out of the selected passages. This powerful devotional provides 
Christians with the spiritual nourishment required to strengthen their 
relationships with God. Readers will find themselves inspired by

<p class="normal" id="d0101am-p3">Israel’s weary wanderings were all over, and the promised rest was attained. 
No more moving tents, fiery serpents, fierce Amalekites, and howling 
wildernesses: they came to the land which flowed with milk and honey, 
and they ate the old corn of the land. Perhaps this year, beloved 
Christian reader, this may be thy case or mine. Joyful is the prospect, 
and if faith be in active exercise, it will yield unalloyed delight. 
To be with Jesus in the rest which remaineth for the people of God, 
is a cheering hope indeed, and to expect this glory so soon is a double 
bliss. Unbelief shudders at the Jordan which still rolls between us 
and the goodly land, but let us rest assured that we have already 
experienced more ills than death at its worst can cause us. Let us 
banish every fearful thought, and rejoice with exceeding great joy, 
in the prospect that this year we shall begin to be “forever with the Lord.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0101am-p4">A part of the host will this year tarry on earth, to do service for 
their Lord. If this should fall to our lot, there is no reason why 
the New Year’s text should not still be true. “We who have believed do enter into rest.” The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance; he gives us “glory begun below.” In heaven they are secure, and so are we preserved in Christ Jesus; 
there they triumph over their enemies, and we have victories too. 
Celestial spirits enjoy communion with their Lord, and this is not 
denied to us; they rest in his love, and we have perfect peace in 
him: they hymn his praise, and it is our privilege to bless him too. 
We will this year gather celestial fruits on earthly ground, where 
faith and hope have made the desert like the garden of the Lord. Man 
did eat angels’ food of old, and why not now? O for grace to feed on Jesus, and so 
to eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan this year!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0101pm-p3">We will be glad and rejoice in thee. We will not open the gates of 
the year to the dolorous notes of the sackbut, but to the sweet strains 
of the harp of joy, and the high sounding cymbals of gladness. “O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise unto 
the rock of our salvation.” We, the called and faithful and chosen, we will drive away our griefs, 
and set up our banners of confidence in the name of God. Let others 
lament over their troubles, we who have the sweetening tree to cast 
into Marah’s bitter pool, with joy will magnify the Lord. Eternal Spirit, our 
effectual Comforter, we who are the temples in which thou dwellest, 
will never cease from adoring and blessing the name of Jesus. <i>We</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0101pm-p3.1">will</span>, we are resolved about it, Jesus must have the crown of our heart’s delight; we will not dishonour our Bridegroom by mourning in his 
presence. We are ordained to be the minstrels of the skies, let us 
rehearse our everlasting anthem before we sing it in the halls of 
the New Jerusalem. <i>We will</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0101pm-p3.2">be glad and rejoice</span>: two words with one sense, double joy, blessedness upon blessedness. 
Need there be any limit to our rejoicing in the Lord even now? Do 
not men of grace find their Lord to be camphire and spikenard, calamus 
and cinnamon even now, and what better fragrance have they in heaven 
itself? <i>We will be glad and rejoice</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0101pm-p3.3">in Thee</span>. That last word is the meat in the dish, the kernel of the nut, 
the soul of the text. What heavens are laid up in Jesus! What rivers 
of infinite bliss have their source, aye, and every drop of their 
fulness in him! Since, O sweet Lord Jesus, thou art the present portion 
of thy people, favour us this year with such a sense of thy preciousness, 
that from its first to its last day we may be glad and rejoice in 
thee. Let January open with joy in the Lord, and December close with 
gladness in Jesus.</p>

<p class="crossref" id="d0102am-p1"><a href="#d0102pm" id="d0102am-p1.1">Go To Evening Reading</a></p>

<p class="passage" id="d0102am-p2"><i>“Continue in prayer.”</i></p>
<scripCom type="Meditation" passage="Col 4:2" id="d0102am-p2.1" parsed="|Col|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.4.2" />
<h3 class="scripPassage" id="d0102am-p2.2"><scripRef passage="Col 4:2" id="d0102am-p2.3" parsed="|Col|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.4.2">Colossians 4:2</scripRef></h3>
<p class="normal" id="d0102am-p3">It is interesting to remark how large a portion of Sacred Writ is 
occupied with the subject of prayer, either in furnishing examples, 
enforcing precepts, or pronouncing promises. We scarcely open the 
Bible before we read, “Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord;” and just as we are about to close the volume, the “Amen” of an earnest supplication meets our ear. Instances are plentiful. 
Here we find a wrestling Jacob—there a Daniel who prayed three times a day—and a David who with all his heart called upon his God. On the mountain 
we see Elias; in the dungeon Paul and Silas. We have multitudes of 
commands, and myriads of promises. What does this teach us, but the 
sacred importance and necessity of prayer? We may be certain that 
whatever God has made prominent in his Word, he intended to be conspicuous 
in our lives. If he has said much about prayer, it is because he knows 
we have much need of it. So deep are our necessities, that until we 
are in heaven we must not cease to pray. Dost thou want nothing? Then, 
I fear thou dost not know thy poverty. Hast thou no mercy to ask of 
God? Then, may the Lord’s mercy show thee thy misery! A prayerless soul is a Christless soul. 
Prayer is the lisping of the believing infant, the shout of the fighting 
believer, the requiem of the dying saint falling asleep in Jesus. 
It is the breath, the watchword, the comfort, the strength, the honour 
of a Christian. If thou be a child of God, thou wilt seek thy Father’s face, and live in thy Father’s love. Pray that this year thou mayst be holy, humble, zealous, and 
patient; have closer communion with Christ, and enter oftener into 
the banqueting-house of his love. Pray that thou mayst be an example 
and a blessing unto others, and that thou mayst live more to the glory 
of thy Master. The motto for this year must be, “Continue in prayer.”</p>

<p class="passage" id="d0102pm-p2"><i>“Let the people renew their strength.”</i></p>
<scripCom type="Meditation" passage="Is 41:1" id="d0102pm-p2.1" parsed="|Isa|41|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.41.1" />
<h3 class="scripPassage" id="d0102pm-p2.2"><scripRef passage="Is 41:1" id="d0102pm-p2.3" parsed="|Isa|41|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.41.1">Isaiah 41:1</scripRef></h3>
<p class="normal" id="d0102pm-p3">All things on earth need to be renewed. No created thing continueth 
by itself. “Thou renewest the face of the year,” was the Psalmist’s utterance. Even the trees, which wear not themselves with care, 
nor shorten their lives with labour, must drink of the rain of heaven 
and suck from the hidden treasures of the soil. The cedars of Lebanon, 
which God has planted, only live because day by day they are full 
of sap fresh drawn from the earth. Neither can man’s life be sustained without renewal from God. As it is necessary to 
repair the waste of the body by the frequent meal, so we must repair 
the waste of the soul by feeding upon the Book of God, or by listening 
to the preached Word, or by the soul-fattening table of the ordinances. 
How depressed are our graces when means are neglected! What poor starvelings 
some saints are who live without the diligent use of the Word of God 
and secret prayer! If our piety can live without God it is not of 
divine creating; it is but a dream; for if God had begotten it, it 
would wait upon him as the flowers wait upon the dew. Without constant 
restoration we are not ready for the perpetual assaults of hell, or 
the stern afflictions of heaven, or even for the strifes within. When 
the whirlwind shall be loosed, woe to the tree that hath not sucked 
up fresh sap, and grasped the rock with many intertwisted roots. When 
tempests arise, woe to the mariners that have not strengthened their 
mast, nor cast their anchor, nor sought the haven. If we suffer the 
good to grow weaker, the evil will surely gather strength and struggle 
desperately for the mastery over us; and so, perhaps, a painful desolation, 
and a lamentable disgrace may follow. Let us draw near to the footstool 
of divine mercy in humble entreaty, and we shall realize the fulfilment 
of the promise, “They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0103am-p3">Jesus Christ is himself the sum and substance of the covenant, and 
as one of its gifts. He is the property of every believer. Believer, 
canst thou estimate what thou hast gotten in Christ? “In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” Consider that word “God” and its infinity, and then meditate upon “perfect man” and all his beauty; for all that Christ, as God and man, ever had, 
or can have, is thine—out of pure free favour, passed over to thee to be thine entailed 
property forever. Our blessed Jesus, as God, is omniscient, omnipresent, 
omnipotent. Will it not console you to know that all these great and 
glorious attributes are altogether yours? Has he power? That power 
is yours to support and strengthen you, to overcome your enemies, 
and to preserve you even to the end. Has he love? Well, there is not 
a drop of love in his heart which is not yours; you may dive into 
the immense ocean of his love, and you may say of it all, “It is mine.” Hath he justice? It may seem a stern attribute, but even that is 
yours, for he will by his justice see to it that all which is promised 
to you in the covenant of grace shall be most certainly secured to 
you. And all that he has as <i>perfect man</i> is yours. As a perfect man the Father’s delight was upon him. He stood accepted by the Most High. O believer, 
God’s acceptance of Christ is thine acceptance; for knowest thou not that 
the love which the Father set on a perfect Christ, he sets on thee 
<i>now</i>? For all that Christ did is thine. That perfect righteousness which 
Jesus wrought out, when through his stainless life he kept the law 
and made it honourable, is thine, and is imputed to thee. Christ is 
in the covenant.</p>

despairing must be removed; and self-seeking and carnal delights must 
be forsaken. Across these deep valleys a glorious causeway of grace 
must be raised.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0103pm-p5"><i>Every mountain and hill shall be laid low</i>. Proud creature-sufficiency, and boastful self-righteousness, must 
be levelled, to make a highway for the King of kings. Divine fellowship 
is never vouchsafed to haughty, highminded sinners. The Lord hath 
respect unto the lowly, and visits the contrite in heart, but the 
lofty are an abomination unto him. My soul, beseech the Holy Spirit 
to set thee right in this respect.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0103pm-p6"><i>The crooked shall be made straight</i>. The wavering heart must have a straight path of decision for God 
and holiness marked out for it. Double-minded men are strangers to 
the God of truth. My soul, take heed that thou be in all things honest 
and true, as in the sight of the heart-searching God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0103pm-p7"><i>The rough places shall be made smooth</i>. Stumbling-blocks of sin must be removed, and thorns and briers of 
rebellion must be uprooted. So great a visitor must not find miry 
ways and stony places when he comes to honour his favoured ones with 
his company. Oh that this evening the Lord may find in my heart a 
highway made ready by his grace, that he may make a triumphal progress 
through the utmost bounds of my soul, from the beginning of this year 
even to the end of it.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0104am-p3">“Grow in grace”—not in one grace only, but in <i>all</i> grace. Grow in that root-grace, <i>faith</i>. Believe the promises more firmly than you have done. Let faith increase 
in fulness, constancy, simplicity. Grow also in <i>love</i>. Ask that your love may become extended, more intense, more practical, 
influencing every thought, word, and deed. Grow likewise in <i>humility</i>. Seek to lie very low, and know more of your own nothingness. As 
you grow <i>downward</i> in humility, seek also to grow <i>upward</i>—having nearer approaches to God in prayer and more intimate fellowship 
with Jesus. May God the Holy Spirit enable you to “<i>grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</i>.” He who grows not in the knowledge of Jesus, refuses to be blessed. 
To know him is “life eternal,” and to advance in the knowledge of him is to increase in happiness. 
He who does not long to know more of Christ, knows nothing of him 
yet. Whoever hath sipped this wine will thirst for more, for although 
Christ doth satisfy, yet it is such a satisfaction, that the appetite 
is not cloyed, but whetted. If you know the love of Jesus—as the hart panteth for the water-brooks, so will you pant after deeper 
draughts of his love. If you do not desire to know him better, then 
you love him not, for love always cries, “Nearer, nearer.” Absence from Christ is hell; but the presence of Jesus is heaven. 
Rest not then content without an increasing acquaintance with Jesus. 
Seek to know more of him in his divine nature, in his human relationship, 
in his finished work, in his death, in his resurrection, in his present 
glorious intercession, and in his future royal advent. Abide hard 
by the Cross, and search the mystery of his wounds. An increase of 
love to Jesus, and a more perfect apprehension of his love to us is 
one of the best tests of growth in grace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0104pm-p3">This morning our desires went forth for growth in our acquaintance 
with the Lord Jesus; it may be well tonight to consider a kindred 
topic, namely, <i>our heavenly Joseph's</i> <i>knowledge of us</i>. This was most blessedly perfect long before we had the slightest 
knowledge of him. “His eyes beheld our substance, yet being imperfect, and in his book 
all our members were written, when as yet there was none of them.” Before we had a being in the world we had a being in his heart. When 
we were enemies to him, he knew us, our misery, our madness, and our 
wickedness. When we wept bitterly in despairing repentance, and viewed 
him only as a judge and a ruler, he viewed us as his brethren well 
beloved, and his bowels yearned towards us. He never mistook his chosen, 
but always beheld them as objects of his infinite affection. “The Lord knoweth them that are his,” is as true of the prodigals who are feeding swine as of the children 
who sit at the table.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0104pm-p4">But, alas! <i>we knew not our royal Brother</i>, and out of this ignorance grew a host of sins. We withheld our hearts 
from him, and allowed him no entrance to our love. We mistrusted him, 
and gave no credit to his words. We rebelled against him, and paid 
him no loving homage. The Sun of Righteousness shone forth, and we 
could not see him. Heaven came down to earth, and earth perceived 
it not. Let God be praised, those days are over with us; yet even 
now it is but little that we know of Jesus compared with what he knows 
of us. We have but begun to study him, but he knoweth us altogether. 
It is a blessed circumstance that the ignorance is not on his side, 
for then it would be a hopeless case for us. He will not say to us, 
“I never knew you,” but he will confess our names in the day of his appearing, and meanwhile 
will manifest himself to us as he doth not unto the world.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0105am-p3">Light might well be good since it sprang from that fiat of goodness, 
“Let there be light.” We who enjoy it should be more grateful for it than we are, and see 
more of God in it and by it. Light <i>physical</i> is said by Solomon to be sweet, but <i>gospel</i> light is infinitely more precious, for it reveals eternal things, 
and ministers to our immortal natures. When the Holy Spirit gives 
us <i>spiritual</i> light, and opens our eyes to behold the glory of God in the face 
of Jesus Christ, we behold sin in its true colours, and ourselves 
in our real position; we see the Most Holy God as he reveals himself, 
the plan of mercy as he propounds it, and the world to come as the 
Word describes it. Spiritual light has many beams and prismatic colours, 
but whether they be knowledge, joy, holiness, or life, all are divinely 
good. If the light received be thus good, what must the <i>essential</i> light be, and how glorious must be the place where he reveals himself. 
O Lord, since light is so good, give us more of it, and more of thyself, 
the true light.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0105am-p4">No sooner is there a good thing in the world, than <i>a</i> <i>division is necessary</i>. Light and darkness have no communion; God has divided them, let 
us not confound them. Sons of light must not have fellowship with 
deeds, doctrines, or deceits of darkness. The children of the day 
must be sober, honest, and bold in their Lord’s work, leaving the works of darkness to those who shall dwell in 
it forever. Our Churches should by discipline divide the light from 
the darkness, and we should by our distinct separation from the world 
do the same. In judgment, in action, in hearing, in teaching, in association, 
we must discern between the precious and the vile, and maintain the 
great distinction which the Lord made upon the world’s first day. O Lord Jesus, be thou our light throughout the whole 
of this day, for thy light is the light of men.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0105pm-p3">This morning we noticed the goodness of the light, and the Lord’s dividing it from the darkness, we now note the special eye which 
the Lord had for the light. “God saw the light”—he looked at it with complacency, gazed upon it with pleasure, saw 
that it “was good.” If the Lord has given you light, dear reader, he looks on that light 
with peculiar interest; for not only is it dear to him as his own 
handiwork, but because it is like himself, for “He is light.” Pleasant it is to the believer to know that God’s eye is thus tenderly observant of that work of grace which he has 
begun. He never loses sight of the treasure which he has placed in 
our earthen vessels. Sometimes we cannot see the light, but God always 
sees the light, and that is much better than our seeing it. Better 
for the judge to see my innocence than for me to think I see it. It 
is very comfortable for me to know that I am one of God’s people—but whether <i>I</i> know it or not, if the Lord knows it, I am still safe. This is the 
foundation, “The Lord knoweth them that are his.” You may be sighing and groaning because of inbred sin, and mourning 
over your darkness, yet the Lord sees “light” in your heart, for he has put it there, and all the cloudiness and 
gloom of your soul cannot conceal your light from his gracious eye. 
You may have sunk low in despondency, and even despair; but if your 
soul has any longing towards Christ, and if you are seeking to rest 
in his finished work, God sees the “light.” He not only <i>sees</i> it, but he also <i>preserves</i> it in you. “I, the Lord, do keep it.” This is a precious thought to those who, after anxious watching and 
guarding of themselves, feel their own powerlessness to do so. The 
light thus preserved by his grace, he will one day develop into the 
splendour of noonday, and the fulness of glory. The light within is 
the dawn of the eternal day.</p>

Take up the arms of faith against a sea of trouble, and your opposition 
shall yet end your distresses. <i>There is</i> One who careth for you. His eye is fixed on you, his heart beats 
with pity for your woe, and his hand omnipotent shall yet bring you 
the needed help. The darkest cloud shall scatter itself in showers 
of mercy. The blackest gloom shall give place to the morning. He, 
if thou art one of his family, will bind up thy wounds, and heal thy 
broken heart. Doubt not his grace because of thy tribulation, but 
believe that he loveth thee as much in seasons of trouble as in times 
of happiness. What a serene and quiet life might you lead if you would 
leave providing to the God of providence! With a little oil in the 
cruse, and a handful of meal in the barrel, Elijah outlived the famine, 
and you will do the same. If God cares for you, why need you care 
too? Can you trust him for your soul, and not for your body? He has 
never refused to bear your burdens, he has never fainted under their 
weight. Come, then, soul! have done with fretful care, and leave all 
thy concerns in the hand of a gracious God.</p>

be profited thereby. But the hand of the Lord may also be felt in 
another manner, strengthening the soul and lifting the spirit upward 
towards eternal things. O that I may in this sense feel the Lord dealing 
with me! A sense of the divine presence and indwelling bears the soul 
towards heaven as upon the wings of eagles. At such times we are full 
to the brim with spiritual joy, and forget the cares and sorrows of 
earth; the invisible is near, and the visible loses its power over 
us; servant-body waits at the foot of the hill, and the master-spirit

season of divine communion may be vouchsafed to me this evening! The 
Lord knows that I need it very greatly. My graces languish, my corruptions 
rage, my faith is weak, my devotion is cold; all these are reasons 
why his healing hand should be laid upon me. His hand can cool the 
heat of my burning brow, and stay the tumult of my palpitating heart. 
That glorious right hand which moulded the world can new-create my 
mind; the unwearied hand which bears the earth’s huge pillars up can sustain my spirit; the loving hand which incloses 
all the saints can cherish me; and the mighty hand which breaketh 
in pieces the enemy can subdue my sins. Why should I not feel that 
hand touching me this evening? Come, my soul, address thy God with 
the potent plea, that Jesus’ hands were pierced for thy redemption, and thou shalt surely feel 
that same hand upon thee which once touched Daniel and set him upon 
his knees that he might see visions of God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0107am-p3">The believer did not always live to Christ. He began to do so when 
God the Holy Spirit convinced him of sin, and when by grace he was 
brought to see the dying Saviour making a propitiation for his guilt. 
From the moment of the new and celestial birth the man begins to live 
to Christ. Jesus is to believers the one pearl of great price, for 
whom we are willing to part with all that we have. He has so completely 
won our love, that it beats alone for him; to his glory we would live, 
and in defence of his gospel we would die; he is the pattern of our 
life, and the model after which we would sculpture our character. 
Paul’s words mean more than most men think; they imply that the <i>aim and end</i> <i>of his life</i> was Christ—nay, his life itself was Jesus. In the words of an ancient saint, 
he did eat, and drink, and sleep eternal life. Jesus was his very 
breath, the soul of his soul, the heart of his heart, the life of 
his life. Can you say, as a professing Christian, that you live up 
to this idea? Can you honestly say that for you to live is Christ? 
Your business—are you doing it <i>for Christ</i>? Is it not done for self- aggrandizement and for family advantage? 
Do you ask, “Is that a mean reason?” For the <i>Christian</i> it is. He professes to live for Christ; how can he live for another 
object without committing a spiritual adultery? Many there are who 
carry out this principle in some measure; but who is there that dare 
say that he hath lived wholly for Christ as the apostle did? Yet, 
this alone is the true life of a Christian—its source, its sustenance, its fashion, its end, all gathered up 
in one word—Christ Jesus. Lord, accept me; I here present myself, praying to live 
only in thee and to thee. Let me be as the bullock which stands between 
the plough and the altar, to work or to be sacrificed; and let my 
motto be, “Ready for either.”</p>

<i>My spouse</i>, nearest and dearest, united to me by the tenderest bands of love; 
my sweet companion, part of my own self. <i>My sister</i>, by my Incarnation, which makes me bone of thy bone and flesh of 
thy flesh; <i>my spouse</i>, by heavenly betrothal, in which I have espoused thee unto myself 
in righteousness. <i>My sister</i>, whom I knew of old, and over whom I watched from her earliest infancy; 
<i>my spouse</i>, taken from among the daughters, embraced by arms of love, and affianced

ashamed of us, for he dwells with manifest delight upon this two-fold 
relationship. We have the word “my” twice in our version; as if Christ dwelt with rapture on his possession 
of his Church. “His delights were with the sons of men,” because those sons of men were his own chosen ones. He, the Shepherd, 
sought the sheep, because they were <i>his</i> sheep; he has gone about “to seek and to save that which was lost,” because that which was lost was <i>his</i> long before it was lost to itself or lost to him. The church is the 
exclusive portion of her Lord; none else may claim a partnership, 
or pretend to share her love. Jesus, thy church delights to have it 
so! Let every believing soul drink solace out of these wells. Soul! 
Christ is near to thee in ties of relationship; Christ is dear to 
thee in bonds of marriage union, and thou art dear to him; behold 
he grasps both of thy hands with both his own, saying, “<i>My</i> sister, <i>my</i> spouse.” Mark the two sacred holdfasts by which thy Lord gets such a double 
hold of thee that he neither can nor will ever let thee go. Be not, 
O beloved, slow to return the hallowed flame of his love.</p>

formality, lukewarmness, irreverence, wandering of heart and forgetfulness

out an earnest wish that they were eradicated. But why? What prompts 
the wish? It may be that I may walk out and say to myself, ‘In what fine order is my garden kept!’ This is <i>pride</i>. Or, it may be that my neighbours may look over the wall and say, 
‘How finely your garden flourishes!’ This is <i>vanity</i>. Or I may wish for the destruction of the weeds, because I am weary 
of pulling them up. This is indolence.” So that even our desires after holiness may be polluted by ill motives. 
Under the greenest sods worms hide themselves; we need not look long 
to discover them. How cheering is the thought, that when the High 
Priest bore the iniquity of the holy things he wore upon his brow 
the words, “<span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0108am-p3.1">Holiness to the Lord</span>:” and even so while Jesus bears our sin, he presents before his Father’s face not our unholiness, but his own holiness. O for grace to view 
our great High Priest by the eye of faith!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0108pm-p3"><i>Nothing gives the believer so much joy as fellowship with Christ</i>. He has enjoyment as others have in the common mercies of life, he 
can be glad both in God’s gifts and God’s works; but in all these separately, yea, and in all of them added 
together, he doth not find such substantial delight as in the matchless 
person of his Lord Jesus. He has wine which no vineyard on earth ever 
yielded; he has bread which all the corn-fields of Egypt could never 
bring forth. Where can such sweetness be found as we have tasted in 
communion with our Beloved? In our esteem, the joys of earth are little 
better than husks for swine compared with Jesus, the heavenly manna. 
We would rather have one mouthful of Christ’s love, and a sip of his fellowship, than a whole world full of carnal 
delights. What is the chaff to the wheat? What is the sparkling paste 
to the true diamond? What is a dream to the glorious reality? What 
is time’s mirth, in its best trim, compared to our Lord Jesus in his most 
despised estate? If you know anything of the inner life, you will 
confess that our highest, purest, and most enduring joys must be the 
fruit of the tree of life which is in the midst of the Paradise of 
God. No spring yields such sweet water as that well of God which was 
digged with the soldier’s spear. All earthly bliss is of the earth earthy, but the comforts 
of Christ’s presence are like himself, heavenly. We can review our communion 
with Jesus, and find no regrets of emptiness therein; there are no 
dregs in this wine, no dead flies in this ointment. The joy of the 
Lord is solid and enduring. Vanity hath not looked upon it, but discretion 
and prudence testify that it abideth the test of years, and is in 
time and in eternity worthy to be called “the only true delight.” For nourishment, consolation, exhilaration, and refreshment, no wine 
can rival the love of Jesus. Let us drink to the full this evening.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0109am-p3">Christian! here is all thou canst require. To make thee happy thou 
wantest something that shall satisfy thee; and is not this enough? 
If thou canst pour this promise into thy cup, wilt thou not say, with 
David, “My cup runneth over; I have more than heart can wish”? When this is fulfilled, <i>“I am thy God”</i>, art thou not possessor of all things? Desire is insatiable as death, 
but he who filleth all in all can fill it. The capacity of our wishes 
who can measure? But the immeasurable wealth of God can more than 
overflow it. I ask thee if thou art not complete when God is thine? 
Dost thou want anything but God? Is not his all-sufficiency enough 
to satisfy thee if all else should fail? But thou wantest more than 
quiet satisfaction; thou desirest <i>rapturous delight</i>. Come, soul, here is music fit for heaven in this thy portion, for 
God is the Maker of Heaven. Not all the music blown from sweet instruments, 
or drawn from living strings, can yield such melody as this sweet 
promise, “I will be their God.” Here is a deep sea of bliss, a shoreless ocean of delight; come, 
bathe thy spirit in it; swim an age, and thou shalt find no shore; 
dive throughout eternity, and thou shalt find no bottom. “I will be their God.” If this do not make thine eyes sparkle, and thy heart beat high with 
bliss, then assuredly thy soul is not in a healthy state. But thou 
wantest more than present delights—thou cravest something concerning which thou mayest exercise <i>hope</i>; and what more canst thou hope for than the fulfilment of this great 
promise, “I will be their God”? This is the masterpiece of all the promises; its enjoyment makes 
a heaven below, and will make a heaven above. Dwell in the light of 
thy Lord, and let thy soul be always ravished with his love. Get out 
the marrow and fatness which this portion yields thee. Live up to 
thy privileges, and rejoice with unspeakable joy.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0109pm-p3">Delight in divine service is a token of acceptance. Those who serve 
God with a sad countenance, because they do what is unpleasant to 
them, are not serving him at all; they bring the form of homage, but 
the life is absent. Our God requires no slaves to grace his throne; 
he is the Lord of the empire of love, and would have his servants 
dressed in the livery of joy. The angels of God serve him with songs, 
not with groans; a murmur or a sigh would be a mutiny in their ranks. 
That obedience which is not voluntary is disobedience, for the Lord 
looketh at the heart, and if he seeth that we serve him from force, 
and not because we love him, he will reject our offering. Service 
coupled with cheerfulness is heart-service, and therefore true. Take 
away joyful willingness from the Christian, and you have removed <i>the test of his sincerity</i>. If a man be driven to battle, he is no patriot; but he who marches 
into the fray with flashing eye and beaming face, singing, “It is sweet for one’s country to die,” proves himself to be sincere in his patriotism. Cheerfulness is <i>the support of our strength</i>; in the joy of the Lord are we strong. It acts as <i>the remover of</i> <i>difficulties</i>. It is to our service what oil is to the wheels of a railway carriage. 
Without oil the axle soon grows hot, and accidents occur; and if there 
be not a holy cheerfulness to oil our wheels, our spirits will be 
clogged with weariness. The man who is cheerful in his service of 
God, proves that obedience is his element; he can sing,</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0110am-p3">Doubting one! thou hast often said, “I fear I shall never enter heaven.” Fear not! all the people of God shall enter there. I love the quaint 
saying of a dying man, who exclaimed, “I have no fear of going home; I have sent all before me; God’s finger is on the latch of my door, and I am ready for him to enter.” “But,” said one, “are you not afraid lest you should miss your inheritance?” “Nay,” said he, “nay; there is one crown in heaven which the angel Gabriel could not 
wear, it will fit no head but mine. There is one throne in heaven 
which Paul the apostle could not fill; it was made for me, and I shall 
have it.” O Christian, what a joyous thought! thy portion is secure; “there remaineth a rest.” “But cannot I forfeit it?” No, it is entailed. If I be a child of God I shall not lose it. It 
is mine as securely as if I were there. Come with me, believer, and 
let us sit upon the top of Nebo, and view the goodly land, even Canaan. 
Seest thou that little river of death glistening in the sunlight, 
and across it dost thou see the pinnacles of the eternal city? Dost 
thou mark the pleasant country, and all its joyous inhabitants? Know, 
then, that if thou couldst fly across thou wouldst see written upon 
one of its many mansions, “This remaineth for such a one; preserved for him only. He shall be 
caught up to dwell forever with God.” Poor doubting one, see the fair inheritance; it is <i>thine</i>. If thou believest in the Lord Jesus, if thou hast repented of sin, 
if thou hast been renewed in heart, thou art one of the Lord’s people, and there is a place reserved for thee, a crown laid up 
for thee, a harp specially provided for thee. No one else shall have 
thy portion, it is reserved in heaven for thee, and thou shalt have 
it ere long, for there shall be no vacant thrones in glory when all 
the chosen are gathered in.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0110pm-p3">Mark the subject of Job’s devout anticipation “I shall see God.” He does not say, “I shall see the saints”—though doubtless that will be untold felicity—but, “I shall see God.” It is not—“I shall see the pearly gates, I shall behold the walls of jasper, 
I shall gaze upon the crowns of gold,” but “I shall see God.” This is the sum and substance of heaven, this is the joyful hope 
of all believers. It is their delight to see him now in the ordinances 
by faith. They love to behold him in communion and in prayer; but 
there in heaven they shall have an open and unclouded vision, and 
thus seeing “him as he is,” shall be made completely like him. <i>Likeness to God</i>—what can we wish for more? And <i>a sight of God</i>—what can we desire better? Some read the passage, “Yet, I shall see God in my flesh,” and find here an allusion to Christ, as the “Word made flesh,” and that glorious beholding of him which shall be the splendour of 
the latter days. Whether so or not it is certain that Christ shall 
be the object of our eternal vision; nor shall we ever want any joy 
beyond that of seeing him. Think not that this will be a narrow sphere 
for the mind to dwell in. It is but one source of delight, but that 
source is infinite. All his attributes shall be subjects for contemplation, 
and as he is infinite under each aspect, there is no fear of exhaustion. 
His works, his gifts, his love to us, and his glory in all his purposes, 
and in all his actions, these shall make a theme which will be ever 
new. The patriarch looked forward to this sight of God as <i>a personal</i> enjoyment. “Whom mine eye shall behold, and not another.” Take realizing views of heaven’s bliss; think what it will be <i>to you</i>. “<i>Thine eyes</i> shall see the King in his beauty.” All earthly brightness fades and darkens as we gaze upon it, but 
here is a brightness which can never dim, a glory which can never 
fade—“<i>I shall see God</i>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0111am-p3">My soul, examine thyself this morning by the light of this text. Thou 
hast received the word with joy; thy feelings have been stirred and 
a lively impression has been made; but, remember, that to receive 
the word in the ear is one thing, and to receive Jesus into thy very 
soul is quite another; superficial feeling is often joined to inward 
hardness of heart, and a lively impression of the word is not always 
a lasting one. In the parable, the seed in one case fell upon ground 
having a rocky bottom, covered over with a thin layer of earth; when 
the seed began to take root, its downward growth was hindered by the 
hard stone and therefore it spent its strength in pushing its green 
shoot aloft as high as it could, but having no inward moisture derived 
from root nourishment, it withered away. Is this my case? Have I been 
making a fair show in the flesh without having a corresponding inner 
life? Good growth takes place upwards and downwards at the same time. 
Am I rooted in sincere fidelity and love to Jesus? If my heart remains 
unsoftened and unfertilized by grace, the good seed may germinate 
for a season, but it must ultimately wither, for it cannot flourish 
on a rocky, unbroken, unsanctified heart. Let me dread a godliness 
as rapid in growth and as wanting in endurance as Jonah’s gourd; let me count the cost of being a follower of Jesus, above 
all let me feel the energy of his Holy Spirit, and then I shall possess 
an abiding and enduring seed in my soul. If my mind remains as obdurate 
as it was by nature, the sun of trial will scorch, and my hard heart 
will help to cast the heat the more terribly upon the ill-covered 
seed, and my religion will soon die, and my despair will be terrible; 
therefore, O heavenly Sower, plough me first, and then cast the truth 
into me, and let me yield thee a bounteous harvest.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0111pm-p3">How encouraging is the thought of the Redeemer’s never- ceasing intercession for us. When we pray, he pleads for 
us; and when we are <i>not</i> praying, he is advocating our cause, and by his supplications shielding 
us from unseen dangers. Notice the word of comfort addressed to Peter—“Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you 
as wheat; but”—what? “But go and pray for yourself.” That would be good advice, but it is not so written. Neither does 
he say, “But I will keep you watchful, and so you shall be preserved.” That were a great blessing. No, it is, “<i>But I have prayed for thee</i>, that thy faith fail not.” We little know what we owe to our Saviour’s prayers. When we reach the hill-tops of heaven, and look back upon 
all the way whereby the Lord our God hath led us, how we shall praise 
him who, before the eternal throne, undid the mischief which Satan 
was doing upon earth. How shall we thank him because he never held 
his peace, but day and night pointed to the wounds upon his hands, 
and carried our names upon his breastplate! Even before Satan had 
begun to tempt, Jesus had forestalled him and entered a plea in heaven. 
Mercy outruns malice. Mark, he does not say, “Satan hath <i>desired</i> to have you.” He checks Satan even in his very desire, and nips it in the bud. 
He does not say, “But I have desired to pray for you.” No, but “I <i>have</i> prayed for you: I have done it already; I have gone to court and 
entered a counterplea even before an accusation is made.” O Jesus, what a comfort it is that thou hast pleaded our cause against our unseen enemies; countermined their mines, 
and unmasked their ambushes. Here is a matter for joy, gratitude, 
hope, and confidence.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0112pm-p3">We ought not to court publicity for our virtue, or notoriety for our 
zeal; but, at the same time, it is a sin to be always seeking to hide 
that which God has bestowed upon us for the good of others. A Christian 
is not to be a village in a valley, but “a city set upon a hill;” he is not to be a candle under a bushel, but a candle in a candlestick, 
giving light to all. Retirement may be lovely in its season, and to 
hide one’s self is doubtless modest, but the hiding of <i>Christ</i> in us can never be justified, and the keeping back of truth which 
is precious to ourselves is a sin against others and an offence against 
God. If you are of a nervous temperament and of retiring disposition, 
take care that you do not too much indulge this trembling propensity, 
lest you should be useless to the church. Seek in the name of him 
who was not ashamed of you to do some little violence to your feelings, 
and tell to others what Christ has told to you. If thou canst not 
speak with trumpet tongue, use the still small voice. If the pulpit 
must not be thy tribune, if the press may not carry on its wings thy 
words, yet say with Peter and John, “Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee.” By Sychar’s well talk to the Samaritan woman, if thou canst not on the mountain 
preach a sermon; utter the praises of Jesus in the house, if not in 
the temple; in the field, if not upon the exchange; in the midst of 
thine own household, if thou canst not in the midst of the great family 
of man. From the hidden springs within let sweetly flowing rivulets 
of testimony flow forth, giving drink to every passer-by. Hide not 
thy talent; trade with it; and thou shalt bring in good interest to 
thy Lord and Master. To speak for God will be refreshing to ourselves, 
cheering to saints, useful to sinners, and honouring to the Saviour. 
Dumb children are an affliction to their parents. Lord, unloose all 
thy children’s tongue.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0113am-p3">Solomon’s ships had returned in safety, but Jehoshaphat’s vessels never reached the land of gold. Providence prospers one, 
and frustrates the desires of another, in the same business and at 
the same spot, yet the Great Ruler is as good and wise at one time 
as another. May we have grace today, in the remembrance of this text, 
to bless the Lord for ships broken at Ezion-geber, as well as for 
vessels freighted with temporal blessings; let us not envy the more 
successful, nor murmur at our losses as though we were singularly 
and specially tried. Like Jehoshaphat, we may be precious in the Lord’s sight, although our schemes end in disappointment.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0113am-p4">The secret cause of Jehoshaphat’s loss is well worthy of notice, for it is the root of very much of 
the suffering of the Lord’s people; it was his alliance with a sinful family, his fellowship 
with sinners. In <scripRef passage="2Ch 20:37" id="d0113am-p4.1" parsed="|2Chr|20|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Chr.20.37">2 Ch. 20:37</scripRef>, we are told that the Lord sent a prophet to declare, “Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken 
thy works.” This was a fatherly chastisement, which appears to have been blest 
to him; for in the verse which succeeds our morning’s text we find him refusing to allow his servants to sail in the same 
vessels with those of the wicked king. Would to God that Jehoshaphat’s experience might be a warning to the rest of the Lord’s people, to avoid being unequally yoked together with unbelievers! 
A life of misery is usually the lot of those who are united in marriage, 
or in any other way of their own choosing, with the men of the world. 
O for such love to Jesus that, like him, we may be holy, harmless, 
undefiled, and separate from sinners; for if it be not so with us, 
we may expect to hear it often said, <i>“The Lord hath broken thy works.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d0113pm-p3">The axe-head seemed hopelessly lost, and as it was borrowed, the honour 
of the prophetic band was likely to be imperilled, and so the name 
of their God to be compromised. Contrary to all expectation, the iron 
was made to mount from the depth of the stream and to swim; for things 
impossible with man are possible with God. I knew a man in Christ 
but a few years ago who was called to undertake a work far exceeding 
his strength. It appeared so difficult as to involve absurdity in 
the bare idea of attempting it. Yet he was called thereto, and his 
faith rose with the occasion; God honoured his faith, unlooked-for 
aid was sent, and the iron did swim. Another of the Lord’s family was in grievous financial straits, he was able to meet all 
claims, and much more if he could have realized a certain portion 
of his estate, but he was overtaken with a sudden pressure; he sought 
for friends in vain, but faith led him to the unfailing Helper, and 
lo, the trouble was averted, his footsteps were enlarged, and the 
iron did swim. A third had a sorrowful case of depravity to deal with. 
He had taught, reproved, warned, invited, and interceded, but all 
in vain. Old Adam was too strong for young Melancthon, the stubborn 
spirit would not relent. Then came an agony of prayer, and before 
long a blessed answer was sent from heaven. The hard heart was broken, 
the iron did swim.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0113pm-p4">Beloved reader, what is thy desperate case? What heavy matter hast 
thou in hand this evening? Bring it hither. The God of the prophets 
lives, and lives to help his saints. He will not suffer thee to lack 
any good thing. Believe thou in the Lord of hosts! Approach him pleading 
the name of Jesus, and the iron shall swim; thou too shalt see the 
finger of God working marvels for his people. According to thy faith 
be it unto thee, and yet again the iron shall swim.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0114am-p3">By the words “to save” we understand the whole of the great work of salvation, from the 
first holy desire onward to complete sanctification. The words are 
<i>multum in parro</i>: indeed, here is all mercy in one word. Christ is not only “mighty to save” those who repent, but he is able to make men repent. He will carry 
those to heaven who believe; but he is, moreover, mighty to give men 
new hearts and to work faith in them. He is mighty to make the man 
who hates holiness love it, and to constrain the despiser of his name 
to bend the knee before him. Nay, this is not all the meaning, for 
the divine power is equally seen in the after-work. The life of a 
believer is a series of miracles wrought by “the Mighty God.” The bush burns, but is not consumed. He is mighty to keep his people 
holy after he has made them so, and to preserve them in his fear and 
love until he consummates their spiritual existence in heaven. Christ’s might doth not lie in making a believer and then leaving him to 
shift for himself; but he who begins the good work carries it on; 
he who imparts the first germ of life in the dead soul, prolongs the 
divine existence, and strengthens it until it bursts asunder every 
bond of sin, and the soul leaps from earth, perfected in glory. Believer, 
here is encouragement. Art thou praying for some beloved one? Oh, 
give not up thy prayers, for Christ is “mighty to save.” You are powerless to reclaim the rebel, but your Lord is Almighty. 
Lay hold on that mighty arm, and rouse it to put forth its strength. 
Does your own case trouble you? Fear not, for his strength is sufficient 
for you. Whether to begin with others, or to carry on the work in 
you, Jesus is “mighty to save;” the best proof of which lies in the fact that he has saved <i>you</i>. What a thousand mercies that you have not found him mighty to destroy!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0114pm-p3"><i>Sinking times are praying times</i> with the Lord’s servants. Peter neglected prayer at starting upon his venturous 
journey, but when he began to sink his danger made him a suppliant, 
and his cry though late was not too late. In our hours of bodily pain 
and mental anguish, we find ourselves as naturally driven to prayer 
as the wreck is driven upon the shore by the waves. The fox hies to 
its hole for protection; the bird flies to the wood for shelter; and 
even so the tried believer hastens to the mercy seat for safety. Heaven’s great harbour of refuge is All-prayer; thousands of weather-beaten 
vessels have found a haven there, and the moment a storm comes on, 
it is wise for us to make for it with all sail.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0114pm-p4"><i>Short prayers are long enough</i>. There were but three words in the petition which Peter gasped out, 
but they were sufficient for his purpose. Not length but strength 
is desirable. A sense of need is a mighty teacher of brevity. If our 
prayers had less of the tail feathers of pride and more wing they 
would be all the better. Verbiage is to devotion as chaff to the wheat. 
Precious things lie in small compass, and all that is real prayer 
in many a long address might have been uttered in a petition as short 
as that of Peter.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0114pm-p5"><i>Our extremities are the Lord’s opportunities</i>. Immediately a keen sense of danger forces an anxious cry from us 
the ear of Jesus hears, and with him ear and heart go together, and 
the hand does not long linger. At the last moment we appeal to our 
Master, but his swift hand makes up for our delays by instant and 
effectual action. Are we nearly engulfed by the boisterous waters 
of affliction? Let us then lift up our souls unto our Saviour, and 
we may rest assured that he will not suffer us to perish. When we 
can do nothing Jesus can do all things; let us enlist his powerful 
aid upon our side, and all will be well.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0115am-p3">God’s promises were never meant to be thrown aside as waste paper; he 
intended that they should be used. God’s gold is not miser’s money, but is minted to be traded with. Nothing pleases our Lord 
better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see 
his children bring them up to him, and say, “Lord, do as thou hast said.” We glorify God when we plead his promises. Do you think that God 
will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? 
Do you dream that he will be any the less holy for giving holiness 
to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing you 
from your sins? He has said “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your 
sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be 
red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” Faith lays hold upon the promise of pardon, and it does not delay, 
saying, “This is a precious promise, I wonder if it be true?” but it goes straight to the throne with it, and pleads, “Lord, here is the promise, ‘Do as thou hast said.’” Our Lord replies, “Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” When a Christian grasps a promise, if he does not take it to God, 
he dishonours him; but when he hastens to the throne of grace, and 
cries, “Lord, I have nothing to recommend me but this, ‘Thou hast said it;’” then his desire shall be granted. Our heavenly Banker delights to 
cash his own notes. Never let the promise rust. Draw the sword of promise 
out of its scabbard, and use it with holy violence. Think not that 
God will be troubled by your importunately reminding him of his promises. 
He loves to hear the loud outcries of needy souls. It is his delight 
to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The 
sun is not weary of shining, nor the fountain of flowing. It is God’s nature to keep his promises; therefore go at once to the throne 
with “Do as thou hast said.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0115pm-p3">Lying tongues were busy against the reputation of David, but he did 
not defend himself; he moved the case into a higher court, and pleaded 
before the great King himself. Prayer is the safest method of replying 
to words of hatred. The Psalmist prayed in no cold-hearted manner, 
he gave himself to the exercise—threw his whole soul and heart into it—straining every sinew and muscle, as Jacob did when wrestling with 
the angel. Thus, and thus only, shall any of us speed at the throne 
of grace. As a shadow has no power because there is no substance in 
it, even so that supplication, in which a man’s proper self is not thoroughly present in agonizing earnestness and 
vehement desire, is utterly ineffectual, for it lacks that which would 
give it force. “Fervent prayer,” says an old divine, “like a cannon planted at the gates of heaven, makes them fly open.” The common fault with the most of us is our readiness to yield to 
distractions. Our thoughts go roving hither and thither, and we make 
little progress towards our desired end. Like quicksilver our mind 
will not hold together, but rolls off this way and that. How great 
an evil this is! It injures us, and what is worse, it insults our 
God. What should we think of a petitioner, if, while having an audience 
with a prince, he should be playing with a feather or catching a fly?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0115pm-p4">Continuance and perseverance are intended in the expression of our 
text. David did not cry once, and then relapse into silence; his holy 
clamour was continued till it brought down the blessing. Prayer must 
not be our chance work, but our daily business, our habit and vocation. 
As artists give themselves to their models, and poets to their classical 
pursuits, so must we addict ourselves to prayer. We must be immersed 
in prayer as in our element, and so pray without ceasing. Lord, teach 
us so to pray that we may be more and more prevalent in supplication.</p>

I bought thee with my blood. What! not help thee? I have died for 
thee; and if I have done the greater, will I not do the less? <i>Help</i> thee! It is the least thing I will ever do for thee; I <i>have</i> done more, and will do more. Before the world began I chose thee. 
I made the covenant for thee. I laid aside my glory and became a man 
for thee; I gave up my life for thee; and if I did all this, I will 
surely help thee now. In helping thee, I am giving thee what I have 
bought for thee already. If thou hadst need of a thousand times as 
much help, I would give it thee; thou requirest little compared with 
what I am ready to give. 'Tis much for thee to need, but it is nothing 
for me to bestow. ‘<i>Help</i> thee?’ Fear not! If there were an ant at the door of thy granary asking 
for help, it would not ruin thee to give him a handful of thy wheat; 
and thou art nothing but a tiny insect at the door of my all-sufficiency. 
‘I will help thee.’”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0116am-p4">O my soul, is not this enough? Dost thou need more strength than the

him. No man could have taken his life from him justly, for he had 
done no man wrong, and no man could even have lain him by force unless 
he had been pleased to yield himself to die. But lo, one sins and 
another suffers. Justice was offended by us, but found its satisfaction 
in him. Rivers of tears, mountains of offerings, seas of the blood 
of bullocks, and hills of frankincense, could not have availed for 
the removal of sin; but Jesus was cut off for us, and the cause of 
wrath was cut off at once, for sin was put away forever. Herein is 
wisdom, whereby substitution, the sure and speedy way of atonement, 
was devised! Herein is condescension, which brought Messiah, the Prince, 
to wear a crown of thorns, and die upon the cross! Herein is love, 
which led the Redeemer to lay down his life for his enemies!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0116pm-p4">It is not enough, however, to admire the spectacle of the innocent 
bleeding for the guilty, we must make sure of our interest therein. 
The special object of the Messiah’s death was the salvation of his church; have we a part and a lot 
among those for whom he gave his life a ransom? Did the Lord Jesus 
stand as our representative? Are we healed by his stripes? It will 
be a terrible thing indeed if we should come short of a portion in 
his sacrifice; it were better for us that we had never been born. 
Solemn as the question is, it is a joyful circumstance that it is 
one which may be answered clearly and without mistake. To all who 
believe on him the Lord Jesus is a present Saviour, and upon them 
all the blood of reconciliation has been sprinkled. Let all who trust 
in the merit of Messiah’s death be joyful at every remembrance of him, and let their holy 
gratitude lead them to the fullest consecration to his cause.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0117am-p3">The apostle John was privileged to look within the gates of heaven, 
and in describing what he saw, he begins by saying, “I looked, and, lo, a Lamb!” This teaches us that the chief object of contemplation in the heavenly 
state is “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.” Nothing else attracted the apostle’s attention so much as the person of that Divine Being, who hath redeemed 
us by his blood. He is the theme of the songs of all glorified spirits 
and holy angels. Christian, here is joy for thee; thou hast looked, 
and thou hast seen the Lamb. Through thy tears thine eyes have seen 
the Lamb of God taking away thy sins. Rejoice, then. In a little while, 
when thine eyes shall have been wiped from tears, thou wilt see the 
same Lamb <i>exalted on his throne</i>. It is the joy of thy heart to hold daily fellowship with Jesus; 
thou shalt have the same joy to a higher degree in heaven; thou shalt 
enjoy the constant vision of his presence; thou shalt dwell with him 
forever. “I looked, and, lo, a Lamb!” Why, that Lamb is heaven itself; for as good Rutherford says, “Heaven and Christ are the same thing;” to be with Christ is to be in heaven, and to be in heaven is to be 
with Christ. That prisoner of the Lord very sweetly writes in one 
of his glowing letters—“O my Lord Jesus Christ, if I could be in heaven without thee, it would 
be a hell; and if I could be in hell, and have thee still, it would 
be a heaven to me, for thou art all the heaven I want.” It is true, is it not, Christian? Does not thy soul say so?</p>

temptation. Both at home and abroad we are liable to meet with allurements 
to evil; the morning opens with peril, and the shades of evening find 
us still in jeopardy. They are well kept whom God keeps, but woe unto 
those who go forth into the world, or even dare to walk their own 
house unarmed. Those who think themselves secure are more exposed 
to danger than any others. The armour-bearer of Sin is Self-confidence.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0117pm-p4">David should have been engaged in fighting the Lord’s battles, instead of which he tarried at Jerusalem, and gave himself 
up to luxurious repose, for he arose from his bed at eventide. Idleness 
and luxury are the devil’s jackals, and find him abundant prey. In stagnant waters noxious 
creatures swarm, and neglected soil soon yields a dense tangle of 
weeds and briars. Oh for the constraining love of Jesus to keep us 
active and useful! When I see the King of Israel sluggishly leaving 
his couch at the close of the day, and falling at once into temptation, 
let me take warning, and set holy watchfulness to guard the door.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0117pm-p5">Is it possible that the king had mounted his housetop for retirement

however secret, a sanctuary from sin! While our hearts are so like 
a tinder-box, and sparks so plentiful, we had need use all diligence 
in all places to prevent a blaze. Satan can climb housetops, and enter 
closets, and even if we could shut out that foul fiend, our own corruptions 
are enough to work our ruin unless grace prevent. Reader, beware of 
evening temptations. Be not secure. The sun is down but sin is up. 
We need a watchman for the night as well as a guardian for the day. 
O blessed Spirit, keep us from all evil this night. Amen.</p>

it is here! Here he is born to toil and suffer weariness, but in the 
land of the immortal, fatigue is never known. Anxious to serve his 
Master, he finds his strength unequal to his zeal: his constant cry 
is, “Help me to serve thee, O my God.” If he be thoroughly active, he will have much labour; not too much 
for his will, but more than enough for his power, so that he will 
cry out, “I am not wearied <i>of</i> the labour, but I am wearied <i>in it</i>.” Ah! Christian, the hot day of weariness lasts not forever; the sun 
is nearing the horizon; it shall rise again with a brighter day than 
thou hast ever seen upon a land where they serve God day and night, 
and yet rest from their labours. <i>Here</i>, rest is but partial, <i>there</i>, it is <i>perfect</i>. <i>Here</i>, the Christian is always unsettled; he feels that he has not yet 
attained. <i>There</i>, all are at rest; they have attained the summit of the mountain; 
they have ascended to the bosom of their God. Higher they cannot go. 
Ah, toil-worn labourer, only think when thou shalt rest forever! Canst 
thou conceive it? It is a rest <i>eternal</i>; a rest that “remaineth.” Here, my best joys bear “mortal” on their brow; my fair flowers fade; my dainty cups are drained to 
dregs; my sweetest birds fall before Death’s arrows; my most pleasant days are shadowed into nights; and the 
flood-tides of my bliss subside into ebbs of sorrow; but <i>there</i>, everything is immortal; the harp abides unrusted, the crown unwithered, 
the eye undimmed, the voice unfaltering, the heart unwavering, and 
the immortal being is wholly absorbed in infinite delight. Happy day! 
happy! when mortality shall be swallowed up of life, and the Eternal 
Sabbath shall begin.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0118pm-p3">The two disciples on the road to Emmaus had a most profitable journey. 
Their companion and teacher was <i>the best of tutors</i>; the interpreter one of a thousand, in whom are hid all the treasures 
of wisdom and knowledge. The Lord Jesus condescended to become a preacher 
of the gospel, and he was not ashamed to exercise his calling before 
an audience of two persons, neither does he now refuse to become the 
teacher of even one. Let us court the company of so excellent an Instructor, 
for till he is made unto us wisdom we shall never be wise unto salvation.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0118pm-p4">This unrivalled tutor used as his class-book <i>the best of</i> <i>books</i>. Although able to reveal fresh truth, he preferred to expound the 
old. He knew by his omniscience what was the most instructive way 
of teaching, and by turning at once to Moses and the prophets, he 
showed us that the surest road to wisdom is not speculation, reasoning, 
or reading human books, but meditation upon the Word of God. The readiest 
way to be spiritually rich in heavenly knowledge is to dig in this 
mine of diamonds, to gather pearls from this heavenly sea. When Jesus 
himself sought to enrich others, he wrought in the quarry of Holy 
Scripture.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0118pm-p5">The favoured pair were led to consider <i>the best of</i> <i>subjects</i>, for Jesus spake of Jesus, and expounded the things concerning himself. 
Here the diamond cut the diamond, and what could be more admirable? 
The Master of the House unlocked his own doors, conducted the guests 
to his table, and placed his own dainties upon it. He who hid the 
treasure in the field himself guided the searchers to it. Our Lord 
would naturally discourse upon the sweetest of topics, and he could 
find none sweeter than his own person and work: with an eye to these 
we should always search the Word. O for grace to study the Bible with 
Jesus as both our teacher and our lesson!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0119am-p3">Tell me where you lost the company of Christ, and I will tell you 
the most likely place to find him. Have you lost Christ in the closet 
by restraining prayer? Then it is there you must seek and find him. 
Did you lose Christ by sin? You will find Christ in no other way but 
by the giving up of the sin, and seeking by the Holy Spirit to mortify 
the member in which the lust doth dwell. Did you lose Christ by neglecting 
the Scriptures? You must find Christ in the Scriptures. It is a true 
proverb, “Look for a thing where you dropped it, it is there.” So look for Christ where you lost him, for he has not gone away. 
But it is hard work to go back for Christ. Bunyan tells us, the pilgrim 
found the piece of the road back to the Arbour of Ease, where he lost 
his roll, the hardest he had ever travelled. Twenty miles onward is 
easier than to go one mile back for the lost evidence.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0119am-p4">Take care, then, when you find your Master, to cling close to him. 
But how is it you have lost him? One would have thought you would 
never have parted with such a precious friend, whose presence is so 
sweet, whose words are so comforting, and whose company is so dear 
to you! How is it that you did not watch him every moment for fear 
of losing sight of him? Yet, since you have let him go, what a mercy 
that you are seeking him, even though you mournfully groan, “O that I knew where I might find him!” Go on seeking, for it is dangerous to be without thy Lord. Without 
Christ you are like a sheep without its shepherd; like a tree without 
water at its roots; like a sere leaf in the tempest—not bound to the tree of life. With thine whole heart seek him, and 
he will be found of thee: only give thyself thoroughly up to the search, 
and verily, thou shalt yet discover him to thy joy and gladness.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0119pm-p3">He whom we viewed last evening as opening Scripture, we here perceive 
opening the understanding. In the first work he has many fellow-labourers, 
but in the second he stands alone; many can bring the Scriptures to 
the mind, but the Lord alone can prepare the mind to receive the Scriptures. 
Our Lord Jesus differs from all other teachers; they reach the ear, 
but he instructs the heart; they deal with the outward letter, but 
he imparts an inward taste for the truth, by which we perceive its 
savour and spirit. The most unlearned of men become ripe scholars 
in the school of grace when the Lord Jesus by his Holy Spirit unfolds 
the mysteries of the kingdom to them, and grants the divine anointing 
by which they are enabled to behold the invisible. Happy are we if 
we have had our understandings cleared and strengthened by the Master! 
How many men of profound learning are ignorant of eternal things! 
They know the killing letter of revelation, but its killing spirit 
they cannot discern; they have a veil upon their hearts which the 
eyes of carnal reason cannot penetrate. Such was our case a little 
time ago; we who now see were once utterly blind; truth was to us 
as beauty in the dark, a thing unnoticed and neglected. Had it not 
been for the love of Jesus we should have remained to this moment 
in utter ignorance, for without his gracious opening of our understanding, 
we could no more have attained to spiritual knowledge than an infant 
can climb the Pyramids, or an ostrich fly up to the stars. Jesus’ College is the only one in which God’s truth can be really learned; other schools may teach us what is 
to be believed, but Christ’s alone can show us how to believe it. Let us sit at the feet of Jesus, 
and by earnest prayer call in his blessed aid that our dull wits may 
grow brighter, and our feeble understandings may receive heavenly 
things.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0120am-p3">As a shepherd Abel <i>sanctified his work to the glory of God,</i> <i>and offered a sacrifice of blood upon his altar, and the Lord</i> <i>had respect unto Abel and his offering</i>. This early type of our Lord is exceedingly clear and distinct. Like 
the first streak of light which tinges the east at sunrise, it does 
not reveal everything, but it clearly manifests the great fact that 
the sun is coming. As we see Abel, a shepherd and yet a priest, offering 
a sacrifice of sweet smell unto God, we discern our Lord, who brings 
before his Father a sacrifice to which Jehovah ever hath respect. 
Abel was hated by his brother—hated without a cause; and even so was the Saviour: the natural and 
carnal man hated the accepted man in whom the Spirit of grace was 
found, and rested not until his blood had been shed. Abel fell, and 
sprinkled his altar and sacrifice with his own blood, and therein 
sets forth the Lord Jesus slain by the enmity of man while serving 
as a priest before the Lord. “The good Shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.” Let us weep over him as we view him slain by the hatred of mankind, 
staining the horns of his altar with his own blood. <i>Abel’s blood speaketh</i>. “The Lord said unto Cain, ‘The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.’” The blood of Jesus hath a mighty tongue, and the import of its prevailing 
cry is not vengeance but mercy. It is precious beyond all preciousness 
to stand at the altar of our good Shepherd! to see him bleeding there 
as the slaughtered priest, and then to hear his blood speaking peace 
to all his flock, peace in our conscience, peace between Jew and Gentile, 
peace between man and his offended Maker, peace all down the ages 
of eternity for blood-washed men. Abel is the first shepherd in order 
of time, but our hearts shall ever place Jesus first in order of excellence. 
Thou great Keeper of the sheep, we the people of thy pasture bless 
thee with our whole hearts when we see thee slain for us.</p>

all these men know to be vanities; they wear upon their forefront 
their proper name and title. Far more treacherous are those equally 
vain things, the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches. 
A man may follow vanity as truly in the counting-house as in the theatre. 
If he be spending his life in amassing wealth, he passes his days 
in a vain show. Unless we follow Christ, and make our God the great 
object of life, we only differ in appearance from the most frivolous. 
It is clear that there is much need of the first prayer of our text.
</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0120pm-p4">
“Quicken thou me in thy way.” The Psalmist confesses that he is dull, heavy, lumpy, all but dead.
Perhaps, dear reader, you feel the same. We are so sluggish that the 
best motives cannot quicken us, apart from the Lord himself. What! 
will not hell quicken me? Shall I think of sinners perishing, and 
yet not be awakened? Will not heaven quicken me? Can I think of the 
reward that awaiteth the righteous, and yet be cold? Will not death 
quicken me? Can I think of dying, and standing before my God, and 
yet be slothful in my Master’s service? Will not Christ’s love constrain me? Can I think of his dear wounds, can I sit at 
the foot of his cross, and not be stirred with fervency and zeal? 
It seems so! No mere consideration can quicken us to zeal, but God 
Himself must do it, hence the cry, “Quicken <i>thou</i> me.” The Psalmist breathes out his whole soul in vehement pleadings: his 
body and his soul unite in prayer. “Turn away mine eyes,” says the body: “Quicken thou me,” cries the soul. This is a fit prayer for every day. O Lord, hear 
it in my case this night.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0121pm-p3">Samson was thirsty and ready to die. The difficulty was totally different 
from any which the hero had met before. Merely to get thirst assuaged 
is nothing like so great a matter as to be delivered from a thousand 
Philistines! but when the thirst was upon him, Samson felt that little 
present difficulty more weighty than the great past difficulty out 
of which he had so specially been delivered. It is very usual for 
God’s people, when they have enjoyed a great deliverance, to find a little 
trouble too much for them. Samson slays a thousand Philistines, and 
piles them up in heaps, and then faints for a little water! Jacob 
wrestles with God at Peniel, and overcomes Omnipotence itself, and 
then goes “halting on his thigh!” Strange that there must be a shrinking of the sinew whenever we win 
the day. As if the Lord must teach us our littleness, our nothingness, 
in order to keep us within bounds. Samson boasted right loudly when 
he said, “I have slain a thousand men.” His boastful throat soon grew hoarse with thirst, and he betook himself 
to prayer. God has many ways of humbling his people. Dear child of 
God, if after great mercy you are laid very low, your case is not 
an unusual one. When David had mounted the throne of Israel, he said, 
“I am this day weak, though anointed king.” You must expect to feel weakest when you are enjoying your greatest 
triumph. If God has wrought for you great deliverances in the past, 
your present difficulty is only like Samson’s thirst, and the Lord will not let you faint, nor suffer the daughter 
of the uncircumcised to triumph over you. The road of sorrow is the 
road to heaven, but there are wells of refreshing water all along 
the route. So, tried brother, cheer your heart with Samson’s words, and rest assured that God will deliver you ere long.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0122am-p3">These words are for the humbling of God’s people; they are called God’s vine, but what are they by nature more than others? They, by God’s goodness, have become fruitful, having been planted in a good soil; 
the Lord hath trained them upon the walls of the sanctuary, and they 
bring forth fruit to his glory; but what are they without their God? 
What are they without the continual influence of the Spirit, begetting 
fruitfulness in them? O believer, learn to reject pride, seeing that 
thou hast no ground for it. Whatever thou art, thou hast nothing to 
make thee proud. The more thou hast, the more thou art in debt to 
God; and thou shouldst not be proud of that which renders thee a debtor. 
Consider thine origin; look back to what thou wast. Consider what 
thou wouldst have been but for divine grace. Look upon thyself as 
thou art now. Doth not thy conscience reproach thee? Do not thy thousand 
wanderings stand before thee, and tell thee that thou art unworthy 
to be called his son? And if he hath made thee anything, art thou 
not taught thereby that it is grace which hath made thee to differ? 
Great believer, thou wouldst have been a great sinner if God had not 
made thee to differ. O thou who art valiant for truth, thou wouldst 
have been as valiant for error if grace had not laid hold upon thee. 
Therefore, be not proud, though thou hast a large estate—a wide domain of grace, thou hadst not once a single thing to call 
thine own except thy sin and misery. Oh! strange infatuation, that 
thou, who hast borrowed everything, shouldst think of exalting thyself; 
a poor dependent pensioner upon the bounty of thy Saviour, one who 
hath a life which dies without fresh streams of life from Jesus, and 
yet proud! Fie on thee, O silly heart!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0122pm-p3">This was the wicked question of Satan concerning that upright man 
of old, but there are many in the present day concerning whom it might 
be asked with justice, for they love God after a fashion because he 
prospers them; but if things went ill with them, they would give up 
all their boasted faith in God. If they can clearly see that since 
the time of their supposed conversion the world has gone prosperously 
with them, then they will love God in their poor carnal way; but if 
they endure adversity, they rebel against the Lord. Their love is 
the love of the table, not of the host; a love to the cupboard, not 
to the master of the house. As for the true Christian, he expects 
to have his reward in the next life, and to endure hardness in this. 
The promise of the old covenant was prosperity, but the promise of 
the new covenant is adversity. Remember Christ’s words—“Every branch in me that beareth not fruit”—What? “<i>He purgeth it, that it may bring forth fruit</i>.” If you bring forth fruit, you will have to endure affliction. “Alas!” you say, “that is a terrible prospect.” But this affliction works out such precious results, that the Christian 
who is the subject of it must learn to rejoice in tribulations, because 
as his tribulations abound, so his consolations abound by Christ Jesus. 
Rest assured, if you are a child of God, you will be no stranger to 
the rod. Sooner or later every bar of gold must pass through the fire. 
Fear not, but rather rejoice that such fruitful times are in store 
for you, for in them you will be weaned from earth and made meet for 
heaven; you will be delivered from clinging to the present, and made 
to long for those eternal things which are so soon to be revealed 
to you. When you feel that as regards the present you do serve God 
for nought, you will then rejoice in the infinite reward of the future.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0123am-p3">Why was Christ chosen out of the people? Speak, my heart, for heart-thoughts 
are best. Was it not that he might be able to be our brother, in the 
blest tie of kindred blood? Oh, what relationship there is between 
Christ and the believer! The believer can say, “I have a Brother in heaven; I may be poor, but I have a Brother who 
is rich, and is a King, and will he suffer me to want while he is 
on his throne? Oh, no! He loves me; he is my Brother.” Believer, wear this blessed thought, like a necklace of diamonds, 
around the neck of thy memory; put it, as a golden ring, on the finger 
of recollection, and use it as the King’s own seal, stamping the petitions of thy faith with confidence of 
success. He is a brother born for adversity, treat him as such.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0123am-p4">Christ was also chosen out of the people that he might know our wants 
and sympathize with us. “He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.” In all our sorrows we have his sympathy. Temptation, pain, disappointment, 
weakness, weariness, poverty—he knows them all, for he has felt all. Remember this, Christian, 
and let it comfort thee. However difficult and painful thy road, it 
is marked by the footsteps of thy Saviour; and even when thou reachest 
the dark valley of the shadow of death, and the deep waters of the 
swelling Jordan, thou wilt find his footprints there. In all places 
whithersoever we go, he has been our forerunner; each burden we have 
to carry, has once been laid on the shoulders of Immanuel.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0123pm-p3">Jesus will not let his people forget his love. If all the love they 
have enjoyed should be forgotten, he will visit them with fresh love. 
“Do you forget my cross?” says he, “I will cause you to remember it; for at my table I will manifest myself 
anew to you. Do you forget what I did for you in the council-chamber 
of eternity? I will remind you of it, for you shall need a counsellor, 
and shall find me ready at your call.” Mothers do not let their children forget them. If the boy has gone 
to Australia, and does not write home, his mother writes—“Has John forgotten his mother?” Then there comes back a sweet epistle, which proves that the gentle 
reminder was not in vain. So is it with Jesus, he says to us, “Remember me,” and our response is, “We will remember thy love.” <i>We will</i> remember thy love and its matchless history. It is ancient as the 
glory which thou hadst with the Father before the world was. We remember, 
O Jesus, thine eternal love when thou didst become our Surety, and 
espouse us as thy betrothed. We remember the love which suggested 
the sacrifice of thyself, the love which, until the fulness of time, 
mused over that sacrifice, and long for the hour whereof in the volume 
of the book it was written of thee, “Lo, I come.” We remember thy love, O Jesus as it was manifest to us in thy holy 
life, from the manger of Bethlehem to the garden of Gethsemane. We 
track thee from the cradle to the grave—for every word and deed of thine was love—and we rejoice in thy love, which death did not exhaust; thy love 
which shone resplendent in thy resurrection. We remember that burning 
fire of love which will never let thee hold thy peace until thy chosen 
ones be all safely housed, until Zion be glorified, and Jerusalem 
settled on her everlasting foundations of light and love in heaven.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0124am-p3">God delivers his people from the snare of the fowler in two senses. 
<i>From</i>, and <i>out of</i>. First, he delivers them <i>from</i> the snare—does not let them enter it; and secondly, if they should be caught 
therein, he delivers them <i>out of</i> it. The first promise is the most precious to some; the second is 
the best to others.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0124am-p4">“He shall deliver thee <i>from</i> the snare.” How? Trouble is often the means whereby God delivers us. God knows 
that our backsliding will soon end in our destruction, and he in mercy 
sends the rod. We say, “Lord, why is this?” not knowing that our trouble has been the means of delivering us 
from far greater evil. Many have been thus saved from ruin by their 
sorrows and their crosses; these have frightened the birds from the 
net. At other times, God keeps his people <i>from</i> the snare of the fowler by giving them great spiritual strength, 
so that when they are tempted to do evil they say, “How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” But what a blessed thing it is that if the believer shall, in an 
evil hour, come into the net, yet God will bring him out of it! O 
backslider, be cast down, but do not despair. Wanderer though thou 
hast been, hear what thy Redeemer saith—“Return, O backsliding children; I will have mercy upon you.” But you say you cannot return, for you are a captive. Then listen 
to the promise—“Surely he shall deliver thee out of the snare of the fowler.” Thou shalt yet be brought out of all evil into which thou hast fallen, 
and though thou shalt never cease to repent of thy ways, yet he that 
hath loved thee will not cast thee away; he will receive thee, and 
give thee joy and gladness, that the bones which he has broken may 
rejoice. No bird of paradise shall die in the fowler’s net.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0124pm-p3">Her fault was not that she <i>served</i>: the condition of a servant well becomes every Christian. “I serve,” should be the motto of all the princes of the royal family of heaven. 
Nor was it her fault that she had “<i>much</i> serving.” We cannot do too much. Let us do all that we possibly can; let head, 
and heart, and hands, be engaged in the Master’s service. It was no fault of hers that she was busy preparing a feast 
for the Master. Happy Martha, to have an opportunity of entertaining 
so blessed a guest; and happy, too, to have the spirit to throw her 
whole soul so heartily into the engagement. Her fault was that she 
grew “<i>cumbered</i> with much serving,” so that she forgot <i>him</i>, and only remembered the service. She allowed service to override 
communion, and so presented one duty stained with the blood of another. 
We ought to be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, 
and have much communion at the same time. For this we need great grace. 
It is easier to serve than to commune. Joshua never grew weary in 
fighting with the Amalekites; but Moses, on the top of the mountain 
in prayer, needed two helpers to sustain his hands. The more spiritual 
the exercise, the sooner we tire in it. The choicest fruits are the 
hardest to rear: the most heavenly graces are the most difficult to 
cultivate. Beloved, while we do not neglect external things, which 
are good enough in themselves, we ought also to see to it that we 
enjoy living, personal fellowship with Jesus. See to it that sitting 
at the Saviour’s feet is not neglected, even though it be under the specious pretext 
of doing him service. The first thing for our soul’s health, the first thing for his glory, and the first thing for our 
own usefulness, is to keep ourselves in perpetual communion with the 
Lord Jesus, and to see that the vital spirituality of our religion 
is maintained over and above everything else in the world.</p>

spirit you have nothing to do with: you are not a slave, but a child; 
and now, inasmuch as you are a beloved child, you are bound to obey 
your Father’s faintest wish, the least intimation of his will. Does he bid you 
fulfil a sacred ordinance? It is at your peril that you neglect it, 
for you will be disobeying your Father. Does he command you to seek 
the image of Jesus? Is it not your joy to do so? Does Jesus tell you, 
“Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect”? Then not because the law commands, but because your Saviour enjoins, 
you will labour to be perfect in holiness. Does he bid his saints 
love one another? Do it, not because the law says, “Love thy neighbour,” but because Jesus says, “If ye love me, keep my commandments;” and this is the commandment that he has given unto you, “that ye love one another.” Are you told to distribute to the poor? Do it, not because charity 
is a burden which you dare not shirk, but because Jesus teaches, “Give to him that asketh of thee.” Does the Word say, “Love God with all your heart”? Look at the commandment and reply, “Ah! commandment, Christ hath fulfilled thee already—I have no need, therefore, to fulfil thee for my salvation, but I 
rejoice to yield obedience to thee because God is my Father now and 
he has a claim upon me, which I would not dispute.” May the Holy Ghost make your heart obedient to the constraining power 
of Christ’s love, that your prayer may be, “Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.” Grace is the mother and nurse of holiness, and not the apologist

an obedience demanded which is most cheerfully rendered—which would not be withheld even if it might. The obedience which 
God’s children yield to him must be <i>loving</i> obedience. Do not go about the service of God as slaves to their

of mercy—the sceptre indeed seems to be forgotten in the tender hand of him 
who wields it. Father!—Here is honour and love. How great is a Father’s love to his children! That which friendship cannot do, and mere 
benevolence will not attempt, a father’s heart and hand must do for his sons. They are his offspring, he 
must bless them; they are his children, he must show himself strong 
in their defence. If an earthly father watches over his children with 
unceasing love and care, how much more does our heavenly Father? Abba, 
Father! He who can say this, hath uttered better music than cherubim

voice with bowed head in humble prayer, yet it silently adores. Our 
incarnate God is to be worshipped as “the Wonderful.” That God should consider his fallen creature, man, and instead of 
sweeping him away with the besom of destruction, should himself undertake 
to be man’s Redeemer, and to pay his ransom price, is, indeed marvellous! But 
to each believer redemption is most marvellous as he views it in relation 
to himself. It is a miracle of grace indeed, that Jesus should forsake 
the thrones and royalties above, to suffer ignominiously below <i>for you</i>. Let your soul lose itself in wonder, for wonder is in this way a 
very practical emotion. Holy wonder will lead you to <i>grateful worship</i> and <i>heartfelt thanksgiving</i>. It will cause within you <i>godly</i> <i>watchfulness</i>; you will be afraid to sin against such a love as this. Feeling the 
presence of the mighty God in the gift of his dear Son, you will put 
off your shoes from off your feet, because the place whereon you stand 
is holy ground. You will be moved at the same time to <i>glorious hope</i>. If Jesus has done such marvellous things on your behalf, you will 
feel that heaven itself is not too great for your expectation. Who 
can be astonished at anything, when he has once been astonished at 
the manger and the cross? What is there wonderful left after one has 
seen the Saviour? Dear reader, it may be that from the quietness and 
solitariness of your life, you are scarcely able to imitate the shepherds 
of Bethlehem, who told what they had seen and heard, but you can, 
at least, fill up the circle of the worshippers before the throne, 
by wondering at what God has done.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0127am-p3">These words tell us that there is a fulness in Christ. There is a 
fulness of essential Deity, for “in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.” There is a fulness of perfect manhood, for in him, bodily, that Godhead 
was revealed. There is a fulness of atoning efficacy in his blood, 
for “the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.” There is a fulness of justifying righteousness in his life, for “there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ 
Jesus.” There is a fulness of divine prevalence in his plea, for “He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him; 
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” There is a fulness of victory in his death, for through death he 
destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil. There 
is a fulness of efficacy in his resurrection from the dead, for by 
it “we are begotten again unto a lively hope.” There is a fulness of triumph in his ascension, for “when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and received 
gifts for men.” There is a fulness of blessings of every sort and shape; a fulness 
of grace to pardon, of grace to regenerate, of grace to sanctify, 
of grace to preserve, and of grace to perfect. There is a fulness 
at all times; a fulness of comfort in affliction; a fulness of guidance 
in prosperity. A fulness of every divine attribute, of wisdom, of 
power, of love; a fulness which it were impossible to survey, much 
less to explore. “It pleased the Father that in him should <i>all</i> fulness dwell.” Oh, what a fulness must this be of which <i>all</i> receive! Fulness, indeed, must there be when the stream is always 
flowing, and yet the well springs up as free, as rich, as full as 
ever. Come, believer, and get all thy need supplied; ask largely, 
and thou shalt receive largely, for this “fulness” is inexhaustible, and is treasured up where all the needy may reach 
it, even in Jesus, Immanuel—God with us.</p>

powers of her being: her <i>memory</i>—she kept all these things; her <i>affections</i>—she kept them in her heart; her <i>intellect</i>—she pondered them; so that memory, affection, and understanding, were 
all exercised about the things which she had heard. Beloved, remember 
what you have heard of your Lord Jesus, and what he has done for you; 
make your heart the golden pot of manna to preserve the memorial of 
the heavenly bread whereon you have fed in days gone by. Let your 
memory treasure up everything about Christ which you have either felt, 
or known, or believed, and then let your fond affections hold <i>him</i> fast for evermore. Love the person of your Lord! Bring forth the 
alabaster box of your heart, even though it be broken, and let all 
the precious ointment of your affection come streaming on his pierced 
feet. Let your intellect be exercised concerning the Lord Jesus. Meditate 
upon what you read: stop not at the surface; dive into the depths. 
Be not as the swallow which toucheth the brook with her wing, but 
as the fish which penetrates the lowest wave. Abide with your Lord: 
let him not be to you as a wayfaring man, that tarrieth for a night, 
but constrain him, saying, “Abide with us, for the day is far spent.” Hold him, and do not let him go. The word “ponder,” means to weigh. Make ready the balances of judgment. Oh, but where 
are the scales that can weigh the Lord Christ? “He taketh up the isles as a very little thing:”—who shall take <i>him</i> up? “He weigheth the mountains in scales”—in what scales shall we weigh <i>him</i>? Be it so, if your understanding cannot comprehend, let your affections 
apprehend; and if your spirit cannot compass the Lord Jesus in the

<p class="normal" id="d0128am-p3">Do you not feel in your own soul that perfection is not in you? Does 
not every day teach you that? Every tear which trickles from your 
eye, weeps “imperfection;” every harsh word which proceeds from your lip, mutters “imperfection.” You have too frequently had a view of your own heart to dream for 
a moment of any perfection <i>in yourself</i>. But amidst this sad consciousness of imperfection, here is comfort 
for you—you are “perfect in <i>Christ Jesus</i>.” In God’s sight, you are “complete in him;” <i>even now</i> you are “accepted in the Beloved.” But there is a second perfection, yet to be realized, which is sure 
to all the seed. Is it not delightful to look forward to the time 
when every stain of sin shall be removed from the believer, and he 
shall be presented faultless before the throne, without spot, or wrinkle, 
or any such thing? The Church of Christ then will be so pure, that 
not even the eye of Omniscience will see a spot or blemish in her; 
so holy and so glorious, that Hart did not go beyond the truth when

art, thou shalt be clean. Oh, it is a marvellous salvation this! Christ 
takes a worm and transforms it into an angel; Christ takes a black 
and deformed thing and makes it clean and matchless in his glory, 
peerless in his beauty, and fit to be the companion of seraphs. O 
my soul, stand and admire this blessed truth of perfection in Christ.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0128pm-p3">What was the subject of their praise? They <i>praised God for</i> <i>what they had heard</i>—for the good tidings of great joy that a Saviour was born unto them. 
Let us copy them; let us also raise a song of thanksgiving that we 
have heard of Jesus and his salvation. They also <i>praised God for what they had seen</i>. There is the sweetest music—what we have experienced, what we have felt within, what we have made 
our own—“the things which we have made touching the King.” It is not enough to <i>hear</i> about Jesus: mere hearing may tune the harp, but the fingers of living 
faith must create the music. If you have seen Jesus with the God-giving 
sight of faith, suffer no cobwebs to linger among the harp strings, 
but loud to the praise of sovereign grace, awake your psaltery and 
harp. One point for which they praised God was <i>the agreement between what they had heard and what</i> <i>they had seen</i>. Observe the last sentence—“As it was told unto them.” Have you not found the gospel to be in yourselves just what the Bible 
said it would be? Jesus said he would give you rest—have you not enjoyed the sweetest peace in him? He said you should 
have joy, and comfort, and life through believing in him—have you not received all these? Are not his ways ways of pleasantness, 
and his paths paths of peace? Surely you can say with the queen of 
Sheba, “The half has not been told me.” I have found Christ more sweet than his servants ever said he was. 
I looked upon his likeness as they painted it, but it was a mere daub 
compared with himself; for the King in his beauty outshines all imaginable 
loveliness. Surely what we have “<i>seen</i>” keeps pace with, nay, far exceeds, what we have “<i>heard</i>.” Let us, then, glorify and praise God for a Saviour so precious, and 
so satisfying.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0129am-p3">In our Christian pilgrimage it is well, for the most part, to be looking 
forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. Whether it 
be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring of our 
love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye of 
faith. Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin 
and death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker 
of the inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the 
believer’s enlightened eye can see death’s river passed, the gloomy stream forded, and the hills of light attained 
on which standeth the celestial city; he seeth himself enter within 
the pearly gates, hailed as more than conqueror, crowned by the hand 
of Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, and 
made to sit together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome 
and has sat down with the Father on his throne. The thought of this 
future may well relieve the darkness of the past and the gloom of 
the present. The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows 
of earth. Hush, hush, my doubts! death is but a narrow stream, and 
thou shalt soon have forded it. Time, how short—eternity, how long! Death, how brief—immortality, how endless! Methinks I even now eat of Eshcol’s clusters, and sip of the well which is within the gate. The road 
is so, so short! I shall soon be there.</p>

weary with its toils. Unto the preserver of men lift I my song of 
gratitude. The dove found no rest out of the ark, and therefore returned 
to it; and my soul has learned yet more fully than ever, this day, 
that there is no satisfaction to be found in earthly things—God alone can give rest to my spirit. As to my business, my possessions, 
my family, my attainments, these are all well enough in their way, 
but they cannot fulfil the desires of my immortal nature. “Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully 
with thee.” It was at the still hour, when the gates of the day were closing, 
that with weary wing the dove came back to the master: O Lord, enable 
me this evening thus to return to Jesus. She could not endure to spend 
a night hovering over the restless waste, nor can I bear to be even 
for another hour away from Jesus, the rest of my heart, the home of 
my spirit. She did not merely alight upon the roof of the ark, she 
“came in to him;” even so would my longing spirit look into the secret of the Lord, 
pierce to the interior of truth, enter into that which is within the 
veil, and reach to my Beloved in very deed. To Jesus must I come: 
short of the nearest and dearest intercourse with him my panting spirit 
cannot stay. Blessed Lord Jesus, be with me, reveal thyself, and abide 
with me all night, so that when I awake I may be still with thee. 
I note that the dove brought in her mouth an olive branch plucked 
off, the memorial of the past day, and a prophecy of the future. Have 
I no pleasing record to bring home? No pledge and earnest of lovingkindness 
yet to come? Yes, my Lord, I present thee my grateful acknowledgments 
for tender mercies which have been new every morning and fresh every 
evening; and now, I pray thee, put forth thy hand and take thy dove 
into thy bosom.</p>

he has no heritage apart from us. All the glorious consequences of 
his obedience unto death are the joint riches of all who are in him,

your right lies in Christ. If you are pardoned, it is through <i>his</i> blood; if you are justified, it is through <i>his</i> righteousness; if you are sanctified, it is because <i>he</i> is made of God unto you sanctification; if you shall be kept from 
falling, it will be because you are preserved in Christ Jesus; and 
if you are perfected at the last, it will be because you are complete 
in <i>him</i>. Thus Jesus is magnified—for all is in him and by him; thus the inheritance is made certain 
to us—for it is obtained in him; thus each blessing is the sweeter, and 
even heaven itself the brighter, because it is Jesus our Beloved “in whom” we have obtained all. Where is the man who shall estimate our divine 
portion? Weigh the riches of Christ in scales, and his treasure in 
balances, and then think to count the treasures which belong to the 
saints. Reach the bottom of Christ’s sea of joy, and then hope to understand the bliss which God hath 
prepared for them that love him. Overleap the boundaries of Christ’s possessions, and then dream of a limit to the fair inheritance of 
the elect. “All things are yours, for ye are Christ’s and Christ is God's.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0131am-p3">It will always give a Christian the greatest calm, quiet, ease, and 
peace, to think of the perfect righteousness of Christ. How often 
are the saints of God downcast and sad! I do not think they ought 
to be. I do not think they would if they could always see their perfection 
in Christ. There are some who are always talking about corruption, 
and the depravity of the heart, and the innate evil of the soul. This 
is quite true, but why not go a little further, and remember that 
we are “perfect in Christ Jesus.” It is no wonder that those who are dwelling upon their own corruption 
should wear such downcast looks; but surely if we call to mind that 
“Christ is made unto us righteousness,” we shall be of good cheer. What though distresses afflict me, though 
Satan assault me, though there may be many things to be experienced 
before I get to heaven, those are done for me in the covenant of divine 
grace; there is nothing wanting in my Lord, Christ hath done it all. 
On the cross he said, “It is finished!” and if it be finished, then am I complete in him, and can rejoice 
with joy unspeakable and full of glory, “Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which 
is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God 
by faith.” You will not find on this side heaven a holier people than those 
who receive into their hearts the doctrine of Christ’s righteousness. When the believer says, “I live on Christ alone; I rest on him solely for salvation; and I 
believe that, however unworthy, I am still saved in Jesus;” then there rises up as a motive of gratitude this thought—“Shall I not live to Christ? Shall I not love him and serve him, seeing 
that I am saved by his merits?” “The love of Christ constraineth us,” “that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but 
unto him which died for them.” If saved by imputed righteousness, we shall greatly value imparted 
righteousness.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0131pm-p3">Running is not everything, there is much in the way which we select: 
a swift foot over hill and down dale will not keep pace with a slower 
traveller upon level ground. How is it with my spiritual journey, 
am I labouring up the hill of my own works and down into the ravines 
of my own humiliations and resolutions, or do I run by the plain way 
of “Believe and live”? How blessed is it to wait upon the Lord by faith! The soul runs 
without weariness, and walks without fainting, in the way of believing. 
Christ Jesus is the way of life, and he is a plain way, a pleasant 
way, a way suitable for the tottering feet and feeble knees of trembling 
sinners: am I found in this way, or am I hunting after another track 
such as priestcraft or metaphysics may promise me? I read of the way 
of holiness, that the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err 
therein: have I been delivered from proud reason and been brought 
as a little child to rest in Jesus’ love and blood? If so, by God’s grace I shall outrun the strongest runner who chooses any other 
path. This truth I may remember to my profit in my daily cares and 
needs. It will be my wisest course to go at once to my God, and not 
to wander in a roundabout manner to this friend and that. He knows 
my wants and can relieve them, to whom should I repair but to himself 
by the direct appeal of prayer, and the plain argument of the promise. 
“Straightforward makes the best runner.” I will not parlay with the servants, but hasten to their master.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0131pm-p4">In reading this passage, it strikes me that if men vie with each other 
in common matters, and one outruns the other, I ought to be in solemn 
earnestness so to run that I may obtain. Lord, help me to gird up 
the loins of my mind, and may I press forward towards the mark for 
the prize of my high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0201am-p3">The time when Christians begin to sing in the ways of the Lord is 
when they first lose their burden at the foot of the Cross. Not even 
the songs of the angels seem so sweet as the first song of rapture 
which gushes from the inmost soul of the forgiven child of God. You 
know how John Bunyan describes it. He says when poor Pilgrim lost 
his burden at the Cross, he gave three great leaps, and went on his 
way singing—</p>
<verse id="d0201am-p3.1">

</verse>
<p class="normal" id="d0201am-p4">Believer, do you recollect the day when <i>your</i> fetters fell off? Do you remember the place when Jesus met you, and 
said, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love; I have blotted out as 
a cloud thy transgressions, and as a thick cloud thy sins; they shall 
not be mentioned against thee any more forever.” Oh! what a sweet season is that when Jesus takes away the pain of 
sin. When the Lord first pardoned my sin, I was so joyous that I could 
scarce refrain from dancing. I thought on my road home from the house 
where I had been set at liberty, that I must tell the stones in the 
street the story of my deliverance. So full was my soul of joy, that 
I wanted to tell every snow-flake that was falling from heaven of 
the wondrous love of Jesus, who had blotted out the sins of one of 
the chief of rebels. But it is not only at the commencement of the 
Christian life that believers have reason for song; as long as they 
live they discover cause to sing in the ways of the Lord, and their 
experience of his constant lovingkindness leads them to say, “I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be 
in my mouth.” See to it, brother, that thou magnifiest the Lord <i>this day</i>.</p>

love, not of Jonathan, but of Jesus. We will not relate what we have 
been told, but the things which we have tasted and handled-of the 
love of Christ. Thy love to me, O Jesus, was wonderful when I was 
a stranger wandering far from thee, fulfilling the desires of the 
flesh and of the mind. Thy love restrained me from committing the 
sin which is unto death, and withheld me from self-destruction. Thy 
love held back the axe when Justice said, “Cut it down! why cumbereth it the ground?” Thy love drew me into the wilderness, stripped me there, and made 
me feel the guilt of my sin, and the burden of mine iniquity. Thy 
love spake thus comfortably to me when, I was sore dismayed—“Come unto me, and I will give thee rest.” Oh, how matchless thy love when, in a moment, thou didst wash my 
sins away, and make my polluted soul, which was crimson with the blood 
of my nativity, and black with the grime of my transgressions, to 
be white as the driven snow, and pure as the finest wool. How thou 
didst commend thy love when thou didst whisper in my ears, “I am thine and thou art mine.” Kind were those accents when thou saidst, “The Father himself loveth you.” And sweet the moments, passing sweet, when thou declaredst to me 
“the love of the Spirit.” Never shall my soul forget those chambers of fellowship where thou 
has unveiled thyself to me. Had Moses his cleft in the rock, where 
he saw the train, the back parts of his God? We, too, have had our 
clefts in the rock, where we have seen the full splendours of the 
Godhead in the person of Christ. Did David remember the tracks of 
the wild goat, the land of Jordan and the Hermonites? We, too, can 
remember spots to memory dear, equal to these in blessedness. Precious 
Lord Jesus, give us a fresh draught of thy wondrous love to begin 
the month with. Amen.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0202am-p3">This is the voice of unalterable truth. In none of the Jewish ceremonies 
were sins, even typically, removed without blood-shedding. In no case, 
by no means can sin be pardoned without atonement. It is clear, then, 
that there is no hope for me out of Christ; for there is no other 
blood-shedding which is worth a thought as an atonement for sin. Am 
I, then, believing in him? Is the blood of his atonement truly applied 
to my soul? All men are on a level as to their need of him. If we 
be never so moral, generous, amiable, or patriotic, the rule will 
not be altered to make an exception for us. Sin will yield to nothing 
less potent than the blood of him whom God hath set forth as a propitiation. 
What a blessing that there is the one way of pardon! Why should we 
seek another?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0202am-p4">Persons of merely formal religion cannot understand how we can rejoice 
that all our sins are forgiven us for Christ’s sake. Their works, and prayers, and ceremonies, give them very poor 
comfort; and well may they be uneasy, for they are neglecting the 
one great salvation, and endeavouring to get remission without blood. 
My soul, sit down, and behold the justice of God as bound to punish 
sin; see that punishment all executed upon thy Lord Jesus, and fall 
down in humble joy, and kiss the dear feet of him whose blood has 
made atonement for thee. It is in vain when conscience is aroused 
to fly to feelings and evidences for comfort: this is a habit which 
we learned in the Egypt of our legal bondage. The only restorative 
for a guilty conscience is a sight of Jesus suffering on the cross.

of faith and joy and every other holy grace.</p>

of our souls. Let us for a moment recount them, telling them over 
as misers count their gold. <i>The sovereign choice</i> of the Father, by which he elected us unto eternal life, or ever 
the earth was, is a matter of vast antiquity, since no date can be 
conceived for it by the mind of man. We were chosen from before the 
foundations of the world. <i>Everlasting love</i> went with the choice, for it was not a bare act of divine will by 
which we were set apart, but the divine affections were concerned. 
The Father loved us in and from the beginning. Here is a theme for 
daily contemplation. <i>The eternal purpose</i> to redeem us from our foreseen ruin, to cleanse and sanctify us, 
and at last to glorify us, was of infinite antiquity, and runs side 
by side with immutable love and absolute sovereignty. <i>The</i> <i>covenant</i> is always described as being everlasting, and Jesus, the second party 
in it, had his goings forth of old; he struck hands in sacred suretyship 
long ere the first of the stars began to shine, and it was in him 
that the elect were ordained unto eternal life. Thus in the divine 
purpose a most blessed covenant union was established between the 
Son of God and his elect people, which will remain as the foundation 
of their safety when time shall be no more. Is it not well to be conversant 
with these ancient things? Is it not shameful that they should be 
so much neglected and even rejected by the bulk of professors? If 
they knew more of their own sin, would they not be more ready to adore 
distinguishing grace? Let us both admire and adore tonight, as we

and soul, and strength. Having broken his commandments, as we all 
have, we are debtors to his justice, and we owe to him a vast amount 
which we are not able to pay. But of the <i>Christian</i> it can be said that he does not owe God’s <i>justice</i> anything, for Christ has paid the debt his people owed; for this 
reason the believer owes the more to <i>love</i>. I am a debtor to God’s grace and forgiving mercy; but I am no debtor to his justice, for 
he will never accuse me of a debt already paid. Christ said, “It is finished!” and by that he meant, that whatever his people owed was wiped away 
forever from the book of remembrance. Christ, to the uttermost, has 
satisfied divine justice; the account is settled; the handwriting 
is nailed to the cross; the receipt is given, and we are debtors to 
God’s justice no longer. But then, because we are not debtors to our Lord 
in that sense, we become ten times more debtors to God than we should 
have been otherwise. Christian, pause and ponder for a moment. What 
a debtor thou art to divine <i>sovereignty</i>! How much thou owest to his disinterested love, for he gave his own 
Son that he might die for thee. Consider how much you owe to his forgiving 
<i>grace</i>, that after ten thousand affronts he loves you as infinitely as ever. 
Consider what you owe to his <i>power</i>; how he has raised you from your death in sin; how he has preserved 
your spiritual life; how he has kept you from falling; and how, though 
a thousand enemies have beset your path, you have been able to hold 
on your way. Consider what you owe to his <i>immutability</i>. Though you have changed a thousand times, he has not changed once. 
Thou art as deep in debt as thou canst be to every attribute of God. 
To God thou owest thyself, and all thou hast—yield thyself as a living sacrifice, it is but thy reasonable service.</p>

for wherever thou standest as the Shepherd, there will I lie down 
as a sheep; for none but thyself can supply my need. I cannot be satisfied 
to be apart from thee. My soul hungers and thirsts for the refreshment 
of thy presence. “Where dost thou make thy flock to rest at noon?” for whether at dawn or at noon, my only rest must be where thou art 
and thy beloved flock. My soul’s rest must be a grace-given rest, and can only be found in thee. 
Where is the shadow of that rock? Why should I not repose beneath 
it? “Why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?” Thou hast companions—why should I not be one? Satan tells me I am unworthy; but I always 
was unworthy, and yet thou hast long loved me; and therefore my unworthiness 
cannot be a bar to my having fellowship with thee now. It is true 
I am weak in faith, and prone to fall, but my very feebleness is the 
reason why I should always be where thou feedest thy flock, that I 
may be strengthened, and preserved in safety beside the still waters. 
Why should I turn aside? There is no reason why I should, but there 
are a thousand reasons why I should not, for Jesus beckons me to come. 
If he withdrew himself a little, it is but to make me prize his presence 
more. Now that I am grieved and distressed at being away from him, 
he will lead me yet again to that sheltered nook where the lambs of 
his fold are sheltered from the burning sun.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0204am-p3">Believer, <i>look back</i> through all thine experience, and think of the way whereby the Lord 
thy God has led thee in the wilderness, and how he hath fed and clothed 
thee every day—how he hath borne with thine ill manners—how he hath put up with all thy murmurings, and all thy longings after 
the flesh-pots of Egypt—how he has opened the rock to supply thee, and fed thee with manna 
that came down from heaven. Think of how his grace has been sufficient 
for thee in all thy troubles—how his blood has been a pardon to thee in all thy sins—how his rod and his staff have comforted thee. When thou hast thus 
looked back upon the love of the Lord, then let faith survey his love 
<i>in the</i> <i>future</i>, for remember that Christ’s covenant and blood have something more in them than the <i>past</i>. He who has loved thee and pardoned thee, shall never cease to love 
and pardon. He is Alpha, and he shall be Omega also: he is first, 
and he shall be <i>last</i>. Therefore, bethink thee, when thou shalt pass through the valley 
of the shadow of death, thou needest fear no evil, for he is with 
thee. When thou shalt stand in the cold floods of Jordan, thou needest 
not fear, for death cannot separate thee from his love; and when thou 
shalt come into the mysteries of eternity thou needest not tremble, 
“For I am persuaded, that neither death; nor life, nor angels, nor 
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate 
us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Now, soul, is not thy love refreshed? Does not this make thee love 
Jesus? Doth not a flight through illimitable plains of the ether of 
love inflame thy heart and compel thee to delight thyself in the Lord 
thy God? Surely as we meditate on “the love of the Lord,” our hearts burn within us, and we long to love him more.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0204pm-p3">It is said that in the land of Canaan, cities of refuge were so arranged, 
that any man might reach one of them within half a day at the utmost. 
Even so the word of our salvation is near to us; Jesus is a present 
Saviour, and the way to him is short; it is but a simple renunciation 
of our own merit, and a laying hold of Jesus, to be our all in all. 
With regard to the roads to the city of refuge, we are told that they 
were strictly preserved, every river was bridged, and every obstruction 
removed, so that the man who fled might find an easy passage to the 
city. Once a year the elders went along the roads and saw to their 
order, so that nothing might impede the flight of any one, and cause 
him, through delay, to be overtaken and slain. How graciously do the 
promises of the gospel remove stumbling blocks from the way! Wherever 
there were by-roads and turnings, there were fixed up hand-posts, 
with the inscription upon them—“To the city of refuge!” This is a picture of the road to Christ Jesus. It is no roundabout 
road of the law; it is no obeying this, that, and the other; it is 
a straight road: “Believe, and live.” It is a road so hard, that no self-righteous man can ever tread it, 
but so easy, that every sinner, who knows himself to be a sinner may 
by it find his way to heaven. No sooner did the man-slayer reach the 
outworks of the city than he was safe; it was not necessary for him 
to pass far within the walls, but the suburbs themselves were sufficient 
protection. Learn hence, that if you do but touch the hem of Christ’s garment, you shall be made whole; if you do but lay hold upon him 
with “faith as a grain of mustard seed,” you are safe.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0205am-p3">It is a sweet thought that Jesus Christ did not come forth without 
his Father’s permission, authority, consent, and assistance. He was sent of the 
Father, that he might be the Saviour of men. We are too apt to forget 
that, while there are distinctions as to the <i>persons</i> in the Trinity, there are no distinctions of <i>honour</i>. We too frequently ascribe the honour of our salvation, or at least 
the depths of its benevolence, more to Jesus Christ than we do the 
Father. This is a very great mistake. What if Jesus came? Did not 
his Father send him? If he spake wondrously, did not his Father pour 
grace into his lips, that he might be an able minister of the new 
covenant? He who knoweth the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost 
as he should know them, never setteth one before another in his love; 
he sees them at Bethlehem, at Gethsemane, and on Calvary, all equally 
engaged in the work of salvation. O Christian, hast thou put thy confidence 
in the Man Christ Jesus? Hast thou placed thy reliance solely on him? 
And art thou united with him? Then believe that thou art united unto 
the God of heaven. Since to the Man Christ Jesus thou art brother, 
and holdest closest fellowship, thou art linked thereby with God the 
Eternal, and “the Ancient of days” is thy Father and thy friend. Didst thou ever consider the depth 
of love in the heart of Jehovah, when God the Father equipped his 
Son for the great enterprise of mercy? If not, be this thy day’s meditation. The <i>Father</i> sent him! Contemplate that subject. Think how Jesus works what the 
<i>Father</i> wills. In the wounds of the dying Saviour see the love of the great 
I AM. Let every thought of Jesus be also connected with the Eternal, 
ever-blessed God, for “It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0205pm-p3">This is a singular way in which to commence a verse—“At that time Jesus answered.” If you will look at the context you will not perceive that any person 
had asked him a question, or that he was in conversation with any 
human being. Yet it is written, “Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father.” When a man answers, he answers a person who has been speaking to 
him. Who, then, had spoken to Christ? his Father. Yet there is no 
record of it; and this should teach us that Jesus had constant fellowship 
with his Father, and that God spake into his heart so often, so continually, 
that it was not a circumstance singular enough to be recorded. It 
was the habit and life of Jesus to talk with God. Even as Jesus was, 
in this world, so are we; let us therefore learn the lesson which 
this simple statement concerning him teaches us. May we likewise have 
silent fellowship with the Father, so that often we may answer him, 
and though the world wotteth not to whom we speak, may we be responding 
to that secret voice unheard of any other ear, which our own ear, 
opened by the Spirit of God, recognizes with joy. God has spoken to 
us, let us speak to God—either to set our seal that God is true and faithful to his promise, 
or to confess the sin of which the Spirit of God has convinced us, 
or to acknowledge the mercy which God’s providence has given, or to express assent to the great truths which 
God the Holy Ghost has opened to our understanding. What a privilege 
is intimate communion with the Father of our spirits! It is a secret 
hidden from the world, a joy with which even the nearest friend intermeddleth 
not. If we would hear the whispers of God’s love, our ear must be purged and fitted to listen to his voice. 
This very evening may our hearts be in such a state, that when God 
speaks to us, we, like Jesus, may be prepared at once to answer him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0206am-p3">What multitudes of prayers we have put up from the first moment when 
we learned to pray. Our first prayer was a prayer for ourselves; we 
asked that God would have mercy upon us, and blot out our sin. He 
heard us. But when he had blotted out our sins like a cloud, then 
we had more prayers for ourselves. We have had to pray for sanctifying 
grace, for constraining and restraining grace; we have been led to 
crave for a fresh assurance of faith, for the comfortable application 
of the promise, for deliverance in the hour of temptation, for help 
in the time of duty, and for succour in the day of trial. We have 
been compelled to go to God for our souls, as constant beggars asking 
for everything. Bear witness, children of God, you have never been 
able to get anything for your souls elsewhere. All the bread your 
soul has eaten has come down from heaven, and all the water of which 
it has drank has flowed from the living rock—Christ Jesus the Lord. Your soul has never grown rich in itself; it 
has always been a pensioner upon the daily bounty of God; and hence 
your prayers have ascended to heaven for a range of spiritual mercies 
all but infinite. Your wants were innumerable, and therefore the supplies 
have been infinitely great, and your prayers have been as varied as 
the mercies have been countless. Then have you not cause to say, “I love the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplication”? For as your prayers have been many, so also have been God’s answers to them. He has heard you in the day of trouble, has strengthened 
you, and helped you, even when you dishonoured him by trembling and 
doubting at the mercy-seat. Remember this, and let it fill your heart 
with gratitude to God, who has thus graciously heard your poor weak 
prayers. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0206pm-p3">As an encouragement cheerfully to offer intercessory prayer, remember 
that <i>such prayer is the sweetest God ever hears</i>, for the prayer of Christ is of this character. In all the incense 
which our Great High Priest now puts into the golden censer, there 
is not a single grain for himself. His intercession must be the most 
acceptable of all supplications—and the more like our prayer is to Christ's, the sweeter it will be; 
thus while petitions for ourselves will be accepted, our pleadings 
for others, having in them more of the fruits of the Spirit, more 
love, more faith, more brotherly kindness, will be, through the precious 
merits of Jesus, the sweetest oblation that we can offer to God, the 
very fat of our sacrifice. Remember, again, that <i>intercessory prayer is</i> <i>exceedingly prevalent</i>. What wonders it has wrought! The Word of God teems with its marvellous 
deeds. Believer, thou hast a mighty engine in thy hand, use it well, 
use it constantly, use it with faith, and thou shalt surely be a benefactor 
to thy brethren. When thou hast the King’s ear, speak to him for the suffering members of his body. When thou 
art favoured to draw very near to his throne, and the King saith to 
thee, “Ask, and I will give thee what thou wilt,” let thy petitions be, not for thyself alone, but for the many who 
need his aid. If thou hast grace at all, and art not an intercessor, 
that grace must be small as a grain of mustard seed. Thou hast just 
enough grace to float thy soul clear from the quicksand, but thou 
hast no deep floods of grace, or else thou wouldst carry in thy joyous 
bark a weighty cargo of the wants of others, and thou wouldst bring 
back from thy Lord, for them, rich blessings which but for thee they 
might not have obtained:—</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0208am-p3">When a person is dear, everything connected with him becomes dear 
for his sake. Thus, so precious is the person of the Lord Jesus in 
the estimation of all true believers, that everything about him they 
consider to be inestimable beyond all price. “All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia,” said David, as if the very vestments of the Saviour were so sweetened 
by his person that he could not but love them. Certain it is, that 
there is not a spot where that hallowed foot hath trodden—there is not a word which those blessed lips have uttered—nor a thought which his loving Word has revealed—which is not to us precious beyond all price. And this is true of 
the <i>names</i> of Christ—they are all sweet in the believer’s ear. Whether he be called the Husband of the Church, her Bridegroom, 
her Friend; whether he be styled the Lamb slain from the foundation 
of the world—the King, the Prophet, or the Priest—every title of our Master—Shiloh, Emmanuel, Wonderful, the Mighty Counsellor—every name is like the honeycomb dropping with honey, and luscious 
are the drops that distil from it. But if there be one name sweeter 
than another in the believer’s ear, it is the name of <i>Jesus</i>. Jesus! it is the name which moves the harps of heaven to melody. 
Jesus! the life of all our joys. If there be one name more charming, 
more precious than another, it is this name. It is woven into the 
very warp and woof of our psalmody. Many of our hymns begin with it,

<p class="normal" id="d0208pm-p3">Many persons, if they are asked what they understand by salvation, 
will reply, “Being saved from hell and taken to heaven.” This is one result of salvation, but it is not one tithe of what 
is contained in that boon. It is true our Lord Jesus Christ does redeem 
all his people from the wrath to come; he saves them from the fearful 
condemnation which their sins had brought upon them; but his triumph 
is far more complete than this. He saves his people “from their sins.” Oh! sweet deliverance from our worst foes. Where Christ works a saving 
work, he casts Satan from his throne, and will not let him be master 
any longer. No man is a true Christian if sin reigns in his mortal 
body. Sin will be in us—it will never be utterly expelled till the spirit enters glory; but 
it will never have <i>dominion</i>. There will be a striving for dominion—a lusting against the new law and the new spirit which God has implanted—but sin will never get the upper hand so as to be absolute monarch 
of our nature. Christ will be Master of the heart, and sin must be 
mortified. The Lion of the tribe of Judah shall prevail, and the dragon 
shall be cast out. Professor! is sin subdued in you? If your <i>life</i> is unholy your <i>heart</i> is unchanged, and if your heart is unchanged you are an unsaved person. 
If the Saviour has not sanctified you, renewed you, given you a hatred 
of sin and a love of holiness, he has done nothing in you of a saving 
character. The grace which does not make a man better than others 
is a worthless counterfeit. Christ saves his people, not in their 
sins, but <i>from</i> them. “Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.” “Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” If not saved from sin, how shall we hope to be counted among his 
people. Lord, save me now from all evil, and enable me to honour my 
Saviour.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0209am-p3">When David made this enquiry he had just fought the Philistines, and 
gained a signal victory. The Philistines came up in great hosts, but, 
by the help of God, David had easily put them to flight. Note, however, 
that when they came a second time, David did not go up to fight them 
without enquiring of the Lord. Once he had been victorious, and he 
might have said, as many have in other cases, “I shall be victorious again; I may rest quite sure that if I have 
conquered once I shall triumph yet again. Wherefore should I tarry 
to seek at the Lord’s hands?” Not so, David. He had gained one battle by the strength of the Lord; 
he would not venture upon another until he had ensured the same. He 
enquired, “Shall I go up against them?” He waited until God’s sign was given. Learn from David to take no step without God. Christian, 
if thou wouldst know the path of duty, take God for thy compass; if 
thou wouldst steer thy ship through the dark billows, put the tiller 
into the hand of the Almighty. Many a rock might be escaped, if we 
would let our Father take the helm; many a shoal or quicksand we might 
well avoid, if we would leave to his sovereign will to choose and 
to command. The Puritan said, “As sure as ever a Christian carves for himself, he'll cut his own 
fingers;” this is a great truth. Said another old divine, “He that goes before the cloud of God’s providence goes on a fool’s errand;” and so he does. We must mark God’s providence leading us; and if providence tarries, tarry till providence 
comes. He who goes before providence, will be very glad to run back 
again. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go,” is God’s promise to his people. Let us, then, take all our perplexities to 
him, and say, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” Leave not thy chamber this morning without enquiring of the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0209pm-p3">What we are taught to seek or shun in prayer, we should equally pursue 
or avoid in action. Very earnestly, therefore, should we avoid temptation, 
seeking to walk so guardedly in the path of obedience, that we may 
never tempt the devil to tempt us. We are not to enter the thicket 
in search of the lion. Dearly might we pay for such presumption. This 
lion may cross our path or leap upon us from the thicket, but we have 
nothing to do with hunting him. He that meeteth with him, even though 
he winneth the day, will find it a stern struggle. Let the Christian 
pray that he may be spared the encounter. Our Saviour, who had experience 
of what temptation meant, thus earnestly admonished his disciples—“Pray that ye enter not into temptation.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0209pm-p4">But let us do as we will, we shall be tempted; hence the prayer “deliver us from evil.” God had one Son without sin; but he has no son without temptation. 
The natural man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards, and 
the Christian man is born to temptation just as certainly. We must 
be always on our watch against Satan, because, like a thief, he gives 
no intimation of his approach. Believers who have had experience of 
the ways of Satan, know that there are certain seasons when he will 
most probably make an attack, just as at certain seasons bleak winds 
may be expected; thus the Christian is put on a double guard by fear 
of danger, and the danger is averted by preparing to meet it. Prevention 
is better than cure: it is better to be so well armed that the devil 
will not attack you, than to endure the perils of the fight, even 
though you come off a conqueror. Pray this evening first that you 
may not be tempted, and next that if temptation be permitted, you 
may be delivered from the evil one.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0210am-p3">There are many who know “how to be abased” who have not learned “how to abound.” When they are set upon the top of a pinnacle their heads grow dizzy, 
and they are ready to fall. The Christian far oftener disgraces his 
profession in prosperity than in adversity. It is a dangerous thing 
to be prosperous. The crucible of adversity is a less severe trial 
to the Christian than the refining pot of prosperity. Oh, what leanness 
of soul and neglect of spiritual things have been brought on through 
the very mercies and bounties of God! Yet this is not a matter of 
necessity, for the apostle tells us that he knew how to abound. When 
he had much he knew how to use it. Abundant grace enabled him to bear 
abundant prosperity. When he had a full sail he was loaded with much 
ballast, and so floated safely. It needs more than human skill to 
carry the brimming cup of mortal joy with a steady hand, yet Paul 
had learned that skill, for he declares, “In all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry.” It is a divine lesson to know how to be full, for the Israelites 
were full once, but while the flesh was yet in their mouth, the wrath 
of God came upon them. Many have asked for mercies that they might 
satisfy their own hearts’ lust. Fulness of bread has often made fulness of blood, and that 
has brought on wantonness of spirit. When we have much of God’s providential mercies, it often happens that we have but little of 
God’s grace, and little gratitude for the bounties we have received. We 
are full and we forget God: satisfied with earth, we are content to 
do without heaven. Rest assured it is harder to know how to be full 
than it is to know how to be hungry—so desperate is the tendency of human nature to pride and forgetfulness 
of God. Take care that you ask in your prayers that God would teach 
you “how to be full.”</p>

As clouds obscure the light of the sun, and darken the landscape beneath, 
so do our sins hide from us the light of Jehovah’s face, and cause us to sit in the shadow of death. They are earth-born 
things, and rise from the miry places of our nature; and when so collected 
that their measure is full, they threaten us with storm and tempest. 
Alas! that, unlike clouds, our sins yield us no genial showers, but 
rather threaten to deluge us with a fiery flood of destruction. O

effectually removes the mischief, not by blowing away the cloud, but 
by blotting it out from existence once for all. Against the justified

removed his transgressions from him. On Calvary’s summit the great deed, by which the sin of all the chosen was forever

of communion with the Lord, let us, in the power of the Holy Spirit, 
strive mightily to return. O Lord, this night restore us!</p>

read lives of Christ, beautifully and eloquently written, but the 
best life of Christ is his living biography, written out in the words 
and actions of his people. If we were what we profess to be, and what 
we should be, we should be pictures of Christ; yea, such striking 
likenesses of him, that the world would not have to hold us up by 
the hour together, and say, “Well, it seems somewhat of a likeness;” but they would, when they once beheld us, exclaim, “He has been with Jesus; he has been taught of him; he is like him; 
he has caught the very idea of the holy Man of Nazareth, and he works 
it out in his life and every-day actions.” A Christian should be like Christ in his <i>boldness</i>. Never blush to own your religion; your profession will never disgrace 
you: take care you never disgrace <i>that</i>. Be like Jesus, very valiant for your God. Imitate him in your <i>loving</i> spirit; think kindly, speak kindly, and do kindly, that men may say 
of you, “He has been with Jesus.” Imitate Jesus in his <i>holiness</i>. Was he zealous for his Master? So be you; ever go about doing good. 
Let not time be wasted: it is too precious. Was he self-denying, never 
looking to his own interest? Be the same. Was he devout? Be you fervent 
in your prayers. Had he deference to his Father’s will? So submit yourselves to him. Was he patient? So learn to endure. 
And best of all, as the highest portraiture of Jesus, try to forgive 
your enemies, as he did; and let those sublime words of your Master, 
“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do,” always ring in your ears. Forgive, as you hope to be forgiven. Heap 
coals of fire on the head of your foe by your kindness to him. Good 
for evil, recollect, is godlike. Be godlike, then; and in all ways 
and by all means, so live that all may say of you, “He has been with Jesus.”</p>

in full salvation, and went on our way in peace. It was spring time 
in the soul; the winter was past; the mutterings of Sinai’s thunders were hushed; the flashings of its lightnings were no more 
perceived; God was beheld as reconciled; the law threatened no vengeance, 
justice demanded no punishment. Then the flowers appeared in our heart; 
hope, love, peace, and patience sprung from the sod; the hyacinth 
of repentance, the snowdrop of pure holiness, the crocus of golden 
faith, the daffodil of early love, all decked the garden of the soul. 
The time of the singing of birds was come, and we rejoiced with thanksgiving; 
we magnified the holy name of our forgiving God, and our resolve was, 
“Lord, I am thine, wholly thine; all I am, and all I have, I would 
devote to thee. Thou hast bought me with thy blood—let me spend myself and be spent in thy service. In life and in death 
let me be consecrated to thee.” <i>How have</i> <i>we kept this resolve</i>? Our espousal love burned with a holy flame of devoutedness to Jesus—is it the same <i>now</i>? Might not Jesus well say to us, “I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love”? Alas! it is but little we have done for our Master’s glory. Our winter has lasted all too long. We are as cold as ice 
when we should feel a summer’s glow and bloom with sacred flowers. We give to God pence when he 
deserveth pounds, nay, deserveth our heart’s blood to be coined in the service of his church and of his truth. 
But shall we continue thus? O Lord, after thou hast so richly blessed 
us, shall we be ungrateful and become indifferent to thy good cause

<p class="normal" id="d0212am-p3">There is a blessed proportion. The Ruler of Providence bears a pair 
of scales—in this side he puts his people’s trials, and in that he puts their consolations. When the scale of 
trial is nearly empty, you will always find the scale of consolation 
in nearly the same condition; and when the scale of trials is full, 
you will find the scale of consolation just as heavy. When the black 
clouds gather most, the light is the more brightly revealed to us. 
When the night lowers and the tempest is coming on, the Heavenly Captain 
is always closest to his crew. It is a blessed thing, that when we 
are most cast down, then it is that we are most lifted up by the consolations 
of the Spirit. One reason is, because <i>trials make more room for consolation</i>. Great hearts can only be made by great troubles. The spade of trouble 
digs the reservoir of comfort deeper, and makes more room for consolation. 
God comes into our heart—he finds it full—he begins to break our comforts and to make it empty; then there is 
more room for grace. The humbler a man lies, the more comfort he will 
always have, because he will be more fitted to receive it. Another 
reason why we are often most happy in our troubles, is this—<i>then we have the closest dealings with</i> <i>God</i>. When the barn is full, man can live without God: when the purse 
is bursting with gold, we try to do without so much prayer. But once 
take our <i>gourds</i> away, and we want our <i>God</i>; once cleanse the idols out of the house, then we are compelled to 
honour Jehovah. “Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.” There is no cry so good as that which comes from the bottom of the 
mountains; no prayer half so hearty as that which comes up from the 
depths of the soul, through deep trials and afflictions. Hence they 
bring us to God, and we are happier; for nearness to God is happiness. 
Come, troubled believer, fret not over your heavy troubles, for they 
are the heralds of weighty mercies.</p>

Almighty. Then Jesus came, and the ever-blessed Son in his own proper 
person, was the delight of his people’s eyes. At the time of the Redeemer’s ascension, the Holy Spirit became the head of the present dispensation, 
and his power was gloriously manifested in and after Pentecost. He 
remains at this hour the present Immanuel—God with us, dwelling in and with his people, quickening, guiding, 
and ruling in their midst. Is his presence recognized as it ought 
to be? We cannot control his working; he is most sovereign in all 
his operations, but are we sufficiently anxious to obtain his help, 
or sufficiently watchful lest we provoke him to withdraw his aid? 
Without him we can do nothing, but by his almighty energy the most 
extraordinary results can be produced: everything depends upon his 
manifesting or concealing his power. Do we always look up to him both 
for our inner life and our outward service with the respectful dependence 
which is fitting? Do we not too often run before his call and act 
independently of his aid? Let us humble ourselves this evening for 
past neglects, and now entreat the heavenly dew to rest upon us, the 
sacred oil to anoint us, the celestial flame to burn within us. The 
Holy Ghost is no temporary gift, he abides with the saints. We have 
but to seek him aright, and he will be found of us. He is jealous, 
but he is pitiful; if he leaves in anger, he returns in mercy. Condescending

<p class="normal" id="d0213am-p3">“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.” Consider who we were, and what we feel ourselves to be even now when 
corruption is powerful in us, and you will wonder at our adoption. 
Yet we are called “<i>the sons of God</i>.” What a high relationship is that of a son, and what privileges it 
brings! What care and tenderness the son expects from his father, 
and what love the father feels towards the son! But all <i>that</i>, and more than that, we now have through Christ. As for the temporary 
drawback of suffering with the elder brother, this we accept as an 
honour: “Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.” We are content to be unknown with him in his humiliation, for we 
are to be exalted with him. “<i>Beloved, now are we the sons of God</i>.” That is easy to read, but it is not so easy to feel. How is it with 
your heart this morning? Are you in the lowest depths of sorrow? Does 
corruption rise within your spirit, and grace seem like a poor spark 
trampled under foot? Does your faith almost fail you? Fear not, it 
is neither your graces nor feelings on which you are to live: you 
must live simply by faith on Christ. With all these things against 
us, now—in the very depths of our sorrow, wherever we may be—<i>now</i>, as much in the valley as on the mountain, “Beloved, <i>now</i> are we the sons of God.” “Ah, but,” you say, “see how I am arrayed! my graces are not bright; my righteousness does 
not shine with apparent glory.” But read the next: <i>“It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know</i> <i>that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him</i>.” The Holy Spirit shall purify our minds, and divine power shall refine 
our bodies; then shall <i>we see him as he is</i>.</p>

punished. And more than all, the privileges thou mightst have enjoyed, 
if thou hadst never sinned, are thine now that thou art justified. 
All the blessings which thou wouldst have had if thou hadst kept the 
law, and more, are thine, because Christ has kept it for thee. All 
the love and the acceptance which perfect obedience could have obtained 
of God, belong to thee, because Christ was perfectly obedient on thy

given him as a daily pension. Herein he well pictures the happy position 
of all the Lord’s people. A daily portion is <i>all that a man</i> <i>really wants</i>. We do not need tomorrow’s supplies; that day has not yet dawned, and its wants are as yet 
unborn. The thirst which we may suffer in the month of June does not 
need to be quenched in February, for we do not feel it yet; if we 
have enough for each day as the days arrive we shall never know want. 
Sufficient for the day is <i>all that we can enjoy</i>. We cannot eat or drink or wear more than the day’s supply of food and raiment; the surplus gives us the care of storing 
it, and the anxiety of watching against a thief. One staff aids a 
traveller, but a bundle of staves is a heavy burden. Enough is not 
only as good as a feast, but is all that the greatest glutton can 
truly enjoy. This is <i>all that we should expect</i>; a craving for more than this is ungrateful. When our Father does 
not give us more, we should be content with his daily allowance. Jehoiachin’s case is ours, we have a sure portion, a portion <i>given us of the</i> <i>king</i>, a <i>gracious</i> portion, and a <i>perpetual portion</i>. Here is surely ground for thankfulness.</p>

waiting upon God you shall receive renewed strength. In Jesus all

<p class="normal" id="d0214pm-p3">One of the most touching and teaching of the Saviour’s miracles is before us tonight. The woman was very ignorant. She 
imagined that virtue came out of Christ by a law of necessity, without 
his knowledge or direct will. Moreover, she was a stranger to the 
generosity of Jesus’ character, or she would not have gone behind to steal the cure which 
he was so ready to bestow. Misery should always place itself right 
in the face of mercy. Had she known the love of Jesus’ heart, she would have said, “I have but to put myself where he can see me—his omniscience will teach him my case, and his love at once will 
work my cure.” We admire her faith, but we marvel at her ignorance. After she had 
obtained the cure, she rejoiced with trembling: glad was she that 
the divine virtue had wrought a marvel in her; but she feared lest 
Christ should retract the blessing, and put a negative upon the grant 
of his grace: little did she comprehend the fulness of his love! We 
have not so clear a view of him as we could wish; we know not the 
heights and depths of his love; but we know of a surety that he is 
too good to withdraw from a trembling soul the gift which it has been 
able to obtain. But here is the marvel of it: little as was her knowledge, 
her faith, because it was real faith, saved her, and saved her at 
once. There was no tedious delay—faith’s miracle was instantaneous. If we have faith as a grain of mustard 
seed, salvation is our present and eternal possession. If in the list 
of the Lord’s children we are written as the feeblest of the family, yet, being 
heirs through faith, no power, human or devilish, can eject us from 
salvation. If we dare not lean our heads upon his bosom with John, 
yet if we can venture in the press behind him, and touch the hem of 
his garment, we are made whole. Courage, timid one! thy faith hath 
saved thee; go in peace. “<i>Being</i> justified by faith, we <i>have</i> peace with God.”</p>

Lord, help me to think <i>of</i> thee and <i>for</i> thee; thou hast put me in this world for something; Lord, show me

much; but as the widow put in her two mites, which were all her living,

<p class="normal" id="d0215pm-p3">And who are thus privileged to make the Saviour glad? His church—his people. But is it possible? He makes <i>us</i> glad, but how can <i>we make him glad</i>? By our love. Ah! we think it so cold, so faint; and so, indeed, 
we must sorrowfully confess it to be, but it is very sweet to Christ. 
Hear his own eulogy of that love in the golden Canticle: “How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy 
love than wine!” See, loving heart, how he delights in you. When you lean your head 
on his bosom, you not only receive, but you give him joy; when you 
gaze with love upon his all-glorious face, you not only obtain comfort, 
but impart delight. Our <i>praise</i>, too, gives him joy—not the song of the lips alone, but the melody of the heart’s deep gratitude. Our <i>gifts</i>, too, are very pleasant to him; he loves to see us lay our time, 
our talents, our substance upon the altar, not for the value of what 
we give, but for the sake of the motive from which the gift springs. 
To him the lowly offerings of his saints are more acceptable than 
the thousands of gold and silver. <i>Holiness</i> is like frankincense and myrrh to him. Forgive your enemy, and you 
make Christ glad; distribute of your substance to the poor, and he 
rejoices; be the means of saving souls, and you give him to see of 
the travail of his soul; proclaim his gospel, and you are a sweet 
savour unto him; go among the ignorant and lift up the cross, and 
you have given him honour. It is in your power even now to break the 
alabaster box, and pour the precious oil of joy upon his head, as 
did the woman of old, whose memorial is to this day set forth wherever 
the gospel is preached. Will you be backward then? Will you not perfume 
your beloved Lord with the myrrh and aloes, and cassia, of your heart’s praise? Yes, ye ivory palaces, ye shall hear the songs of the saints!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0216am-p3">These words show us that contentment is not a natural propensity of 
man. “Ill weeds grow apace.” Covetousness, discontent, and murmuring are as natural to man as 
thorns are to the soil. We need not sow thistles and brambles; they 
come up naturally enough, because they are indigenous to earth: and 
so, we need not teach men to complain; they complain fast enough without 
any education. But the precious things of the earth must be cultivated. 
If we would have wheat, we must plough and sow; if we want flowers, 
there must be the garden, and all the gardener’s care. Now, contentment is one of the flowers of heaven, and if we 
would have it, it must be cultivated; it will not grow in us by nature; 
it is the new nature alone that can produce it, and even then we must 
be specially careful and watchful that we maintain and cultivate the 
grace which God has sown in us. Paul says, “I have <i>learned</i> ... to be content;” as much as to say, he did not know how at one time. It cost him some 
pains to attain to the mystery of that great truth. No doubt he sometimes 
thought he had learned, and then broke down. And when at last he had 
attained unto it, and could say, “I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content,” he was an old, grey-headed man, upon the borders of the grave—a poor prisoner shut up in Nero’s dungeon at Rome. We might well be willing to endure Paul’s infirmities, and share the cold dungeon with him, if we too might 
by any means attain unto his good degree. Do not indulge the notion 
that you can be contented without <i>learning</i>, or learn without discipline. It is not a power that may be exercised 
naturally, but a science to be acquired gradually. We know this from 
experience. Brother, hush that murmur, natural though it be, and continue 
a diligent pupil in the College of Content.</p>

good, supremely good. As God, he is good essentially. He shares in 
the threefold ascription of Holy, holy, holy, which ascends to the 
Triune Jehovah. Unmixed purity and truth, and grace is he. He is <i>good benevolently</i>, tenderly bearing with our waywardness, striving with our rebellious 
wills; quickening us from our death in sin, and then training us for 
the skies as a loving nurse fosters her child. How generous, forgiving, 
and tender is this patient Spirit of God. He is <i>good operatively</i>. All his works are good in the most eminent degree: he suggests good 
thoughts, prompts good actions, reveals good truths, applies good 
promises, assists in good attainments, and leads to good results. 
There is no spiritual good in all the world of which he is not the 
author and sustainer, and heaven itself will owe the perfect character 
of its redeemed inhabitants to his work. He is <i>good officially</i>; whether as Comforter, Instructor, Guide, Sanctifier, Quickener, 
or Intercessor, he fulfils his office well, and each work is fraught 
with the highest good to the church of God. They who yield to his 
influences become good, they who obey his impulses do good, they who 
live under his power receive good. Let us then act towards so good 
a person according to the dictates of gratitude. Let us revere his 
person, and adore him as God over all, blessed forever; let us own 
his power, and our need of him by waiting upon him in all our holy 
enterprises; let us hourly seek his aid, and never grieve him; and 
let us speak to his praise whenever occasion occurs. The church will 
never prosper until more reverently it believes in the Holy Ghost. 
He is so good and kind, that it is sad indeed that he should be grieved 
by slights and negligences.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0217am-p3">Hagar had once found deliverance there and Ishmael had drank from 
the water so graciously revealed by the God who liveth and seeth the 
sons of men; but this was a merely casual visit, such as worldlings 
pay to the Lord in times of need, when it serves their turn. They 
cry to him in trouble, but forsake him in prosperity. Isaac <i>dwelt</i> there, and made the well of the living and all-seeing God his constant 
source of supply. The usual tenor of a man’s life, the <i>dwelling</i> of his soul, is the true test of his state. Perhaps the providential 
visitation experienced by Hagar struck Isaac’s mind, and led him to revere the place; its mystical name endeared 
it to him; his frequent musings by its brim at eventide made him familiar 
with the well; his meeting Rebecca there had made his spirit feel 
at home near the spot; but best of all, the fact that he there enjoyed 
fellowship with the living God, had made him select that hallowed 
ground for his dwelling. Let us learn to live in the presence of the 
living God; let us pray the Holy Spirit that this day, and every other 
day, we may feel, “Thou God seest me.” May the Lord Jehovah be as a well to us, delightful, comforting, 
unfailing, springing up unto eternal life. The bottle of the creature 
cracks and dries up, but the well of the Creator never fails; happy 
is he who dwells at the well, and so has abundant and constant supplies 
near at hand. The Lord has been a sure helper to others: his name 
is Shaddai, God All-sufficient; our hearts have often had most delightful

<p class="normal" id="d0217pm-p3">Edom’s princes saw the whole country left desolate, and counted upon its 
easy conquest; but there was one great difficulty in their way—quite unknown to them—“<i>The Lord was there;</i>” 
and in his presence lay the special security of the chosen land. Whatever 
may be the machinations and devices of the enemies of God’s people, there is still the same effectual barrier to thwart their 
design. The saints are God’s heritage, and he is in the midst of them, and will protect his own. 
What comfort this assurance yields us in our troubles and spiritual 
conflicts! We are constantly opposed, and yet perpetually preserved! 
How often Satan shoots his arrows against our <i>faith</i>, but our faith defies the power of hell’s fiery darts; they are not only turned aside, but they are quenched 
upon its shield, for “the Lord is there.” <i>Our good works</i> are the subjects of Satan’s attacks. A saint never yet had a virtue or a grace which was not 
the target for hellish bullets: whether it was hope bright and sparkling, 
or love warm and fervent, or patience all-enduring, or zeal flaming 
like coals of fire, the old enemy of everything that is good has tried 
to destroy it. The only reason why anything virtuous or lovely survives 
in us is this, “the Lord is there.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0217pm-p4">If the Lord be with us through life, we need not fear for our dying 
confidence; for <i>when we come to die</i>, we shall find that “the Lord is <i>there</i>;” where the billows are most tempestuous, and the water is most chill, 
we shall feel the bottom, and know that it is good: our feet shall 
stand upon the Rock of Ages when time is passing away. Beloved, from 
the first of a Christian’s life to the last, the only reason why he does not perish is because 
“<i>the Lord is there</i>.” When the God of everlasting love shall change and leave his elect 
to perish, then may the Church of God be destroyed; but not till then, 
because it is written, <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0217pm-p4.1">Jehovah Shammah</span>, “<i>The Lord is there</i>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0218am-p3">Perhaps, O tried soul, the Lord is doing this to develop thy graces. 
There are some of thy graces which would never be <i>discovered</i> if it were not for thy trials. Dost thou not know that thy faith 
never looks so grand in summer weather as it does in winter? Love 
is too often like a glow-worm, showing but little light except it 
be in the midst of surrounding darkness. Hope itself is like a star—not to be seen in the sunshine of prosperity, and only to be discovered 
in the night of adversity. Afflictions are often the black foils in 
which God doth set the jewels of his children’s graces, to make them shine the better. It was but a little while 
ago that on thy knees thou wast saying, “Lord, I fear I have no faith: let me know that I have faith.” Was not this really, though perhaps unconsciously, praying for trials?—for how canst thou know that thou hast faith until thy faith is exercised? 
Depend upon it, God often sends us trials that our graces may be discovered, 
and that we may be certified of their existence. Besides, it is not 
merely discovery, <i>real growth</i> in grace is the result of sanctified trials. God often takes away 
our comforts and our privileges in order to make us better Christians. 
He trains his soldiers, not in tents of ease and luxury, but by turning 
them out and using them to forced marches and hard service. He makes 
them ford through streams, and swim through rivers, and climb mountains, 
and walk many a long mile with heavy knapsacks of sorrow on their 
backs. Well, Christian, may not this account for the troubles through 
which thou art passing? Is not the Lord bringing out your graces, 
and making them grow? Is not this the reason why he is contending 
with you?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0218pm-p3">It is quite certain that those whom Christ has washed in his precious 
blood need not make a confession of sin, as culprits or criminals, 
before God the Judge, for Christ has forever taken away all their 
sins in a legal sense, so that they no longer stand where they can 
be condemned, but are once for all accepted in the Beloved; but having 
become children, and offending as children, ought they not every day 
to go before their heavenly Father and confess their sin, and acknowledge 
their iniquity in that character? Nature teaches that it is the duty 
of erring children to make a confession to their earthly father, and 
the grace of God in the heart teaches us that we, as Christians, owe 
the same duty to our heavenly Father. We daily offend, and ought not 
to rest without daily pardon. For, supposing that my trespasses against 
my Father are not at once taken to him to be washed away by the cleansing 
power of the Lord Jesus, what will be the consequence? If I have not 
sought forgiveness and been washed from these offences against my 
Father, I shall feel at a distance from him; I shall doubt his love 
to me; I shall tremble at him; I shall be afraid to pray to him: I 
shall grow like the prodigal, who, although still a child, was yet 
far off from his father. But if, with a child’s sorrow at offending so gracious and loving a Parent, I go to him 
and tell him all, and rest not till I realize that I am forgiven, 
then I shall feel a holy love to my Father, and shall go through my 
Christian career, not only as saved, but as one enjoying present peace 
in God through Jesus Christ my Lord. There is a wide distinction between 
confessing sin <i>as a culprit</i>, and confessing sin <i>as a child</i>. The Father’s bosom is the place for penitent confessions. We have been cleansed 
once for all, but our feet still need to be washed from the defilement 
of our daily walk as children of God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0219am-p3">Prayer is the forerunner of mercy. Turn to sacred history, and you 
will find that scarcely ever did a great mercy come to this world 
unheralded by supplication. You have found this true in your own personal 
experience. God has given you many an unsolicited favour, but still 
great prayer has always been the prelude of great mercy with you. 
When you first found peace through the blood of the cross, you had 
been praying much, and earnestly interceding with God that he would 
remove your doubts, and deliver you from your distresses. Your assurance 
was the result of prayer. When at any time you have had high and rapturous 
joys, you have been obliged to look upon them as answers to your prayers. 
When you have had great deliverances out of sore troubles, and mighty 
helps in great dangers, you have been able to say, “I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.” Prayer is always the preface to blessing. It goes before the blessing 
<i>as the blessing's</i> <i>shadow</i>. When the sunlight of God’s mercies rises upon our necessities, it casts the shadow of prayer 
far down upon the plain. Or, to use another illustration, when God 
piles up a hill of mercies, he himself shines behind them, and he 
casts on our spirits the shadow of prayer, so that we may rest certain, 
if we are much in prayer, our pleadings are the shadows of mercy. 
Prayer is thus connected with the blessing <i>to show us the</i> <i>value of it</i>. If we had the blessings without asking for them, we should think 
them common things; but prayer makes our mercies more precious than 
diamonds. The things we ask for are precious, but we do not realize 
their preciousness until we have sought for them earnestly.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0219pm-p3">This case is an excellent pattern of all cases where spiritual life 
is vigorous. <i>As soon as a man has found Christ,</i> <i>he begins to find others</i>. I will not believe that thou hast tasted of the honey of the gospel 
if thou canst eat it all thyself. True grace puts an end to all spiritual 
monopoly. Andrew <i>first</i> found his own brother Simon, and then others. <i>Relationship has a very strong demand upon our first</i> <i>individual efforts</i>. Andrew, thou didst well to begin with Simon. I doubt whether there 
are not some Christians giving away tracts at other people’s houses who would do well to give away a tract at their own—whether there are not some engaged in works of usefulness abroad who 
are neglecting their special sphere of usefulness at home. Thou mayst 
or thou mayst not be called to evangelize the people in any particular 
locality, but certainly thou art called to see after thine own servants, 
thine own kinsfolk and acquaintance. Let thy religion begin at home. 
Many tradesmen export their best commodities—the Christian should not. He should have all his conversation everywhere 
of the best savour; but let him have a care to put forth the sweetest 
fruit of spiritual life and testimony in his own family. When Andrew 
went to find his brother, he little imagined how eminent Simon would 
become. <i>Simon Peter was worth ten Andrews</i> so far as we can gather from sacred history, and yet Andrew was instrumental 
in bringing him to Jesus. You may be very deficient in talent yourself, 
and yet you may be the means of drawing to Christ one who shall become 
eminent in grace and service. Ah! dear friend, you little know the 
possibilities which are in you. You may but speak a word to a child, 
and in that child there may be slumbering a noble heart which shall 
stir the Christian church in years to come. Andrew has only two talents, 
but he finds Peter. Go thou and do likewise.</p>

and wormwood, and comfort him as you may, it will be only a note or 
two of mournful resignation that you will get from him; you will bring 
forth no psalms of praise, no hallelujahs, no joyful sonnets. But 
let <i>God</i> come to his child, let him lift up his countenance, and the mourner’s eyes glisten with hope. Do you not hear him sing—</p>

Christians. One word of God is like a piece of gold, and the Christian

So, then, poor Christian, thou needest not sit down in despair. Go

must pour water down it first of all, and then you will get water,

his joy in thy heart, and then thy joy shall be full. Do not go to 
earthly acquaintances, for you will find them Job’s comforters after all; but go first and foremost to thy “God, that comforteth those that are cast down,” and you will soon say, “In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my

<p class="normal" id="d0220pm-p3">A holy character does not avert temptation—Jesus was tempted. When Satan tempts us, his sparks fall upon tinder; 
but in Christ’s case, it was like striking sparks on water; yet the enemy continued 
his evil work. Now, if the devil goes on striking when there is no 
result, how much more will he do it when he knows what inflammable 
stuff our hearts are made of. Though you become greatly sanctified 
by the Holy Ghost, expect that the great dog of hell will bark at 
you still. In the haunts of men we expect to be tempted, but even 
seclusion will not guard us from the same trial. Jesus Christ was 
led away from human society into the wilderness, and was tempted of 
the devil. Solitude has its charms and its benefits, and may be useful 
in checking the lust of the eye and the pride of life; but the devil 
will follow us into the most lovely retreats. Do not suppose that 
it is only the worldly-minded who have dreadful thoughts and blasphemous 
temptations, for even spiritual-minded persons endure the same; and 
in the holiest position we may suffer the darkest temptation. The 
utmost consecration of spirit will not insure you against Satanic 
temptation. Christ was consecrated through and through. It was his 
meat and drink to do the will of him that sent him: and yet he was 
tempted! Your hearts may glow with a seraphic flame of love to Jesus, 
and yet the devil will try to bring you down to Laodicean lukewarmness. 
If you will tell me when God permits a Christian to lay aside his 
armour, I will tell you when Satan has left off temptation. Like the 
old knights in war time, we must sleep with helmet and breastplate 
buckled on, for the arch-deceiver will seize our first unguarded hour 
to make us his prey. The Lord keep us watchful in all seasons, and 
give us a final escape from the jaw of the lion and the paw of the 
bear.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0221pm-p3">We should be abler teachers of others, and less liable to be carried 
about by every wind of doctrine, if we sought to have a more intelligent 
understanding of the Word of God. As the Holy Ghost, the Author of 
the Scriptures is he who alone can enlighten us rightly to understand 
them, we should constantly ask his teaching, and his guidance into 
all truth. When the prophet Daniel would interpret Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, what did he do? He set himself to earnest prayer that God 
would open up the vision. The apostle John, in his vision at Patmos, 
saw a book sealed with seven seals which none was found worthy to 
open, or so much as to look upon. The book was afterwards opened by 
the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who had prevailed to open it; but 
it is written first—“I wept much.” The tears of John, which were his liquid prayers, were, so far as 
he was concerned, the sacred keys by which the folded book was opened. 
Therefore, if, for your own and others’ profiting, you desire to be “filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,” remember that prayer is your best means of study: like Daniel, you 
shall understand the dream, and the interpretation thereof, when you 
have sought unto God; and like John you shall see the seven seals 
of precious truth unloosed, after you have wept much. Stones are not 
broken, except by an earnest use of the hammer; and the stone-breaker 
must go down on his knees. Use the hammer of diligence, and let the 
knee of prayer be exercised, and there is not a stony doctrine in 
revelation which is useful for you to understand, which will not fly 
into shivers under the exercise of prayer and faith. You may force 
your way through anything with the leverage of prayer. Thoughts and 
reasonings are like the steel wedges which give a hold upon truth; 
but prayer is the lever, the prise which forces open the iron chest

<p class="normal" id="d0222am-p3">That strength which God gives to his Josephs is <i>real</i> strength; it is not a boasted valour, a fiction, a thing of which 
men talk, but which ends in smoke; it is true—<i>divine</i> <i>strength</i>. Why does Joseph stand against temptation? Because God gives him 
aid. There is nought that we can do without the power of God. All 
true strength comes from “the mighty God of Jacob.” Notice in what a <i>blessedly familiar way</i> God gives this strength to Joseph—“The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty 
God of Jacob.” Thus God is represented as putting his hands on Joseph’s hands, placing his arms on Joseph’s arms. Like as a father teaches his children, so the Lord teaches 
them that fear him. He puts his arms upon them. Marvellous condescension! 
God Almighty, Eternal, Omnipotent, stoops from his throne and lays 
his hand upon the child’s hand, stretching his arm upon the arm of Joseph, that he may be 
made strong! This strength was also covenant strength, for it is ascribed 
to “the mighty <i>God of Jacob</i>.” Now, wherever you read of the God of Jacob in the Bible, you should 
remember the covenant with Jacob. Christians love to think of God’s covenant. All the power, all the grace, all the blessings, all the 
mercies, all the comforts, all the things we have, flow to us from 
the well-head, through the covenant. If there were no covenant, then 
we should fail indeed; for all grace proceeds from it, as light and 
heat from the sun. No angels ascend or descend, save upon that ladder 
which Jacob saw, at the top of which stood a covenant God. Christian, 
it may be that the archers have sorely grieved you, and shot at you, 
and wounded you, but still your bow abides in strength; be sure, then, 
to ascribe all the glory to Jacob’s God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0222pm-p3">Jehovah “<i>is slow to anger</i>.” When mercy cometh into the world she driveth winged steeds; the axles 
of her chariot-wheels are red hot with speed; but when wrath goeth 
forth, it toileth on with tardy footsteps, for God taketh no pleasure 
in the sinner’s death. God’s rod of mercy is ever in his hands outstretched; his sword of justice 
is in its scabbard, held down by that pierced hand of love which bled 
for the sins of men. “The Lord is slow to anger,” because he is <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0222pm-p3.1">great in power</span>. He is truly great in power who hath power over himself. When God’s power doth restrain himself, then it is power indeed: the power 
that binds omnipotence is omnipotence surpassed. A man who has a strong 
mind can bear to be insulted long, and only resents the wrong when 
a sense of right demands his action. The weak mind is irritated at 
a little: the strong mind bears it like a rock which moveth not, though 
a thousand breakers dash upon it, and cast their pitiful malice in 
spray upon its summit. God marketh his enemies, and yet he bestirs 
not himself, but holdeth in his anger. If he were less divine than 
he is, he would long ere this have sent forth the whole of his thunders, 
and emptied the magazines of heaven; he would long ere this have blasted 
the earth with the wondrous fires of its lower regions, and man would 
have been utterly destroyed; but the greatness of his power brings 
us mercy. Dear reader, what is your state this evening? Can you by 
humble faith look to Jesus, and say, “My substitute, thou art my rock, my trust”? Then, beloved, be not afraid of God’s power; for by faith you have fled to Christ for refuge, the power 
of God need no more terrify you, than the shield and sword of the 
warrior need terrify those whom he loves. Rather rejoice that he who 
is “great in power” is your Father and Friend.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0223am-p3">No promise is of private interpretation. Whatever God has said to any one saint, he has said to all. When he opens a well for 
one, it is that all may drink. When he openeth a granary-door to give 
out food, there may be some one starving man who is the occasion of 
its being opened, but all hungry saints may come and feed too. Whether 
he gave the word to Abraham or to Moses, matters not, O believer; 
he has given it to thee as one of the covenanted seed. There is not 
a high blessing too lofty for thee, nor a wide mercy too extensive 
for thee. Lift up now thine eyes to the north and to the south, to 
the east and to the west, for all this is thine. Climb to Pisgah’s top, and view the utmost limit of the divine promise, for the land 
is all thine own. There is not a brook of living water of which thou 
mayst not drink. If the land floweth with milk and honey, eat the 
honey and drink the milk, for both are thine. Be thou bold to believe, 
for he hath said, “I will never leave <i>thee</i>, nor forsake <i>thee</i>.”In this promise, God gives to his people everything. “<i>I</i> will never leave thee.” Then no attribute of God can cease to be engaged for us. Is he mighty? 
He will show himself strong on the behalf of them that trust him. 
Is he love? Then with lovingkindness will he have mercy upon us. Whatever 
attributes may compose the character of Deity, every one of them to 
its fullest extent shall be engaged on our side. To put everything 
in one, there is nothing you can want, there is nothing you can ask 
for, there is nothing you can need in time or in eternity, there is 
nothing living, nothing dying, there is nothing in this world, nothing 
in the next world, there is nothing now, nothing at the resurrection-morning, 
nothing in heaven which is not contained in this text—“I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0223pm-p3">You have not the making of your own cross, although unbelief is a 
master carpenter at cross-making; neither are you permitted to choose 
your own cross, although self-will would fain be lord and master; 
but your cross is prepared and appointed for you by divine love, and 
you are cheerfully to accept it; you are to take up the cross as your 
chosen badge and burden, and not to stand cavilling at it. This night 
Jesus bids you submit your shoulder to his easy yoke. Do not kick 
at it in petulance, or trample on it in vain-glory, or fall under 
it in despair, or run away from it in fear, but take it up like a 
true follower of Jesus. Jesus was a cross-bearer; he leads the way 
in the path of sorrow. Surely you could not desire a better guide! 
And if he carried a cross, what nobler burden would you desire? The 
<i>Via</i> <i>Crucis</i> is the way of safety; fear not to tread its thorny paths.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0223pm-p4">Beloved, the cross is not made of feathers, or lined with velvet, 
it is heavy and galling to disobedient shoulders; but it is not an 
iron cross, though your fears have painted it with iron colours, it 
is a wooden cross, and a man can carry it, for the Man of sorrows 
tried the load. Take up your cross, and by the power of the Spirit 
of God you will soon be so in love with it, that like Moses, you would 
not exchange the reproach of Christ for all the treasures of Egypt. 
Remember that Jesus carried it, and it will smell sweetly; remember 
that it will soon be followed by the crown, and the thought of the 
coming weight of glory will greatly lighten the present heaviness 
of trouble. The Lord help you to bow your spirit in submission to 
the divine will ere you fall asleep this night, that waking with to-morrow’s sun, you may go forth to the day’s cross with the holy and submissive spirit which becomes a follower 
of the Crucified.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0224am-p3">Here is <i>sovereign mercy</i>—“I will give them the shower in its season.” Is it not sovereign, <i>divine</i> mercy?—for who can say, “I will give them showers,” except God? There is only one voice which can speak to the clouds, 
and bid them beget the rain. Who sendeth down the rain upon the earth? 
Who scattereth the showers upon the green herb? Do not I, the Lord? 
So grace is the gift of God, and is not to be created by man. It is 
also <i>needed</i> grace. What would the ground do without showers? You may break the 
clods, you may sow your seeds, but what can you do without the rain? 
As absolutely needful is the divine blessing. In vain you labour, 
until God the plenteous shower bestows, and sends salvation down. 
Then, it is <i>plenteous grace</i>. “I will send them showers.” It does not say, “I will send them drops,” but “showers.” So it is with grace. If God gives a blessing, he usually gives it 
in such a measure that there is not room enough to receive it. Plenteous 
grace! Ah! we want plenteous grace to keep us humble, to make us prayerful, 
to make us holy; plenteous grace to make us zealous, to preserve us 
through this life, and at last to land us in heaven. We cannot do 
without saturating showers of grace. Again, it is <i>seasonable grace</i>. “I will cause the shower to come down <i>in his season</i>.” What is thy season this morning? Is it the season of drought? Then 
that is the season for showers. Is it a season of great heaviness 
and black clouds? Then that is the season for showers. “As thy days so shall thy strength be.” And here is a <i>varied</i> blessing. “I will give thee <i>showers</i> of blessing.” The word is in the plural. All kinds of blessings God will send. 
All God’s blessings go together, like links in a golden chain. If he gives 
converting grace, he will also give comforting grace. He will send 
“showers of blessing.” Look up today, O parched plant, and open thy leaves and flowers for 
a heavenly watering.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0224pm-p3">What a sweet answer to an anxious enquiry! This night let us rejoice 
in it. O Zion, there are good things in store for thee; thy time of 
travail shall soon be over; thy children shall be brought forth; thy 
captivity shall end. Bear patiently the rod for a season, and under 
the darkness still trust in God, for his love burneth towards thee. 
God loves the church with a love too deep for human imagination: he 
loves her with all his infinite heart. Therefore let her sons be of 
good courage; she cannot be far from prosperity to whom God speaketh 
“good words and comfortable words.” What these comfortable words are the prophet goes on to tell us: 
“I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.” The Lord loves his church so much that he cannot bear that she should 
go astray to others; and when she has done so, he cannot endure that 
she should suffer too much or too heavily. He will not have his enemies 
afflict her: he is displeased with them because they increase her 
misery. When God seems most to leave his church, his heart is warm 
towards her. History shows that whenever God uses a rod to chasten 
his servants, he always breaks it afterwards, as if he loathed the 
rod which gave his children pain. “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that 
fear him.” God hath not forgotten us because he smites—his blows are no evidences of want of love. If this is true of his 
church <i>collectively</i>, it is of necessity true also of <i>each individual member</i>. You may fear that the Lord has passed you by, but it is not so: 
he who counts the stars, and calls them by their names, is in no danger 
of forgetting his own children. He knows your case as thoroughly as 
if you were the only creature he ever made, or the only saint he ever 
loved. Approach him and be at peace.</p>

sunlight. That is the position of a Christian. He is going through 
a land where the storm has spent itself upon his Saviour’s head, and if there be a few drops of sorrow falling, they distil 
from clouds of mercy, and Jesus cheers him by the assurance that they 
are not for his destruction. But how terrible is it to witness the 
approach of a tempest: to note the forewarnings of the storm; to mark 
the birds of heaven as they droop their wings; to see the cattle as 
they lay their heads low in terror; to discern the face of the sky 
as it groweth black, and look to the sun which shineth not, and the 
heavens which are angry and frowning! How terrible to await the dread 
advance of a hurricane—such as occurs, sometimes, in the tropics—to wait in terrible apprehension till the wind shall rush forth in 
fury, tearing up trees from their roots, forcing rocks from their 
pedestals, and hurling down all the dwelling-places of man! And yet, 
sinner, this is your present position. No hot drops have as yet fallen, 
but a shower of fire is coming. No terrible winds howl around you, 
but God’s tempest is gathering its dread artillery. As yet the water-floods

the thunderbolts of God are yet in his storehouse, but lo! the tempest 
hastens, and how awful shall that moment be when God, robed in vengeance, 
shall march forth in fury! Where, where, where, O sinner, wilt thou 
hide thy head, or whither wilt thou flee? O that the hand of mercy

<p class="normal" id="d0225pm-p3">Instead of going to Nineveh to preach the Word, as God bade him, Jonah 
disliked the work, and went down to Joppa to escape from it. There 
are occasions when God’s servants shrink from duty. But what is the consequence? What did 
Jonah lose by his conduct? <i>He lost the presence and comfortable enjoyment of</i> <i>God’s love</i>. When we serve our Lord Jesus as believers should do, our God is 
with us; and though we have the whole world against us, if we have 
God with us, what does it matter? But the moment we start back, and 
seek our own inventions, we are at sea without a pilot. Then may we 
bitterly lament and groan out, “O my God, where hast thou gone? How could I have been so foolish as 
to shun thy service, and in this way to lose all the bright shinings 
of thy face? This is a price too high. Let me return to my allegiance, 
that I may rejoice in thy presence.” In the next place, Jonah <i>lost all peace of mind</i>. Sin soon destroys a believer’s comfort. It is the poisonous upas tree, from whose leaves distil 
deadly drops which destroy the life of joy and peace. Jonah <i>lost everything upon which he might have drawn</i> <i>for comfort in any other case</i>. He could not plead the promise of divine protection, for he was 
not in God’s ways; he could not say, “Lord, I meet with these difficulties in the discharge of my duty, 
therefore help me through them.” He was reaping his own deeds; he was filled with his own ways. Christian, 
do not play the Jonah, unless you wish to have all the waves and the 
billows rolling over your head. You will find in the long run that 
it is far harder to shun the work and will of God than to at once 
yield yourself to it. <i>Jonah lost his</i> <i>time</i>, for he had to go to Nineveh after all. It is hard to contend with 
God; let us yield ourselves at once.</p>

“dead in trespasses and sins,” and it is he also who maintains the soul in its spiritual life. He 
is both “Alpha and Omega.” “Salvation is of the Lord.” If I am prayerful, God makes me prayerful; if I have graces, they 
are God’s gifts to me; if I hold on in a consistent life, it is because he 
upholds me with his hand. I do nothing whatever towards my own preservation, 
except what God himself first does in me. Whatever I have, all my 
goodness is of the Lord alone. Wherein I sin, that is my own; but 
wherein I act rightly, that is of God, wholly and completely. If I 
have repulsed a spiritual enemy, the Lord’s strength nerved my arm. Do I live before men a consecrated life? 
It is not I, but Christ who liveth in me. Am I sanctified? I did not 
cleanse myself: God’s Holy Spirit sanctifies me. Am I weaned from the world? I am weaned 
by <i>God's</i> chastisements sanctified to my good. Do I grow in knowledge? The 
great Instructor teaches me. All my jewels were fashioned by heavenly 
art. I find in God all that I want; but I find in myself nothing but 
sin and misery. “He only is my rock and my salvation.” Do I feed on the Word? That Word would be no food for me unless the 
Lord made it food for my soul, and helped me to feed upon it. Do I 
live on the manna which comes down from heaven? What is that manna 
but Jesus Christ himself incarnate, whose body and whose blood I eat 
and drink? Am I continually receiving fresh increase of strength? 
Where do I gather my might? My help cometh from heaven’s hills: without Jesus I can do nothing. As a branch cannot bring 
forth fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can I, except I abide 
in him. What Jonah learned in the great deep, let me learn this morning

<p class="normal" id="d0226pm-p3">Strange enough this regulation appears, yet there was wisdom in it, 
for the throwing out of the disease proved that the constitution was 
sound. This evening it may be well for us to see the typical teaching 
of so singular a rule. We, too, are lepers, and may read the law of 
the leper as applicable to ourselves. When a man sees himself to be 
altogether lost and ruined, covered all over with the defilement of 
sin, and in no part free from pollution; when he disclaims all righteousness 
of his own, and pleads guilty before the Lord, then he is clean through 
the blood of Jesus, and the grace of God. Hidden, unfelt, unconfessed 
iniquity is the true leprosy; but when sin is seen and felt, it has 
received its deathblow, and the Lord looks with eyes of mercy upon 
the soul afflicted with it. Nothing is more deadly than self-righteousness, 
or more hopeful than contrition. We must confess that we are “nothing else but sin,” for no confession short of this will be the whole truth; and if the 
Holy Spirit be at work with us, convincing us of sin, there will be 
no difficulty about making such an acknowledgment—it will spring spontaneously from our lips. What comfort does the 
text afford to truly awakened sinners: the very circumstance which 
so grievously discouraged them is here turned into a sign and symptom 
of a hopeful state! Stripping comes before clothing; digging out the 
foundation is the first thing in building—and a thorough sense of sin is one of the earliest works of grace 
in the heart. O thou poor leprous sinner, utterly destitute of a sound 
spot, take heart from the text, and come as thou art to Jesus—</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0227am-p3">The Israelites in the wilderness <i>were continually exposed</i> <i>to change</i>. Whenever the pillar stayed its motion, the tents were pitched; but 
tomorrow, ere the morning sun had risen, the trumpet sounded, the 
ark was in motion, and the fiery, cloudy pillar was leading the way 
through the narrow defiles of the mountain, up the hill side, or along 
the arid waste of the wilderness. They had scarcely time to rest a 
little before they heard the sound of “Away! this is not your rest; you must still be onward journeying towards 
Canaan!” They were never long in one place. Even wells and palm trees could 
not detain them. Yet they had an abiding home in their God, his cloudy 
pillar was their roof-tree, and its flame by night their household 
fire. They must go onward from place to place, continually changing, 
never having time to settle, and to say, “Now we are secure; in this place we shall dwell.” “Yet,” says Moses, “though we are always changing, Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place 
throughout all generations.” The Christian knows no change with regard to God. He may be rich 
today and poor to-morrow; he may be sickly today and well to-morrow; 
he may be in happiness today, to-morrow he may be distressed—but there is no change with regard to his relationship to God. If 
he loved me yesterday, he loves me today. My unmoving mansion of rest 
is my blessed Lord. Let prospects be blighted; let hopes be blasted; 
let joy be withered; let mildews destroy everything; I have lost nothing 
of what I have in God. He is “my strong habitation whereunto I can continually resort.” I am a pilgrim in the world, but at home in my God. In the earth 
I wander, but in God I dwell in a quiet habitation.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0227pm-p3">The Lord Jesus had goings forth for his people <i>as their</i> <i>representative before the throne, long before they appeared</i> <i>upon the stage of time</i>. It was “from everlasting” that he signed the compact with his Father, that he would pay blood 
for blood, suffering for suffering, agony for agony, and death for 
death, in the behalf of his people; it was “from everlasting” that he gave himself up without a murmuring word. That from the crown 
of his head to the sole of his foot he might sweat great drops of 
blood, that he might be spit upon, pierced, mocked, rent asunder, 
and crushed beneath the pains of death. His goings forth as our Surety 
were from everlasting. Pause, my soul, and wonder! Thou hast goings 
forth in the person of Jesus “from everlasting.” Not only when thou wast born into the world did Christ love thee, 
but his delights were with the sons of men before there were any sons 
of men. Often did he think of them; from everlasting to everlasting 
he had set his affection upon them. What! my soul, has he been so 
long about thy salvation, and will not he accomplish it? Has he from 
everlasting been going forth to save me, and will he lose me now? 
What! Has he carried me in his hand, as his precious jewel, and will 
he now let me slip from between his fingers? Did he choose me before 
the mountains were brought forth, or the channels of the deep were 
digged, and will he reject me now? Impossible! I am sure he would 
not have loved me so long if he had not been a changeless Lover. If 
he could grow weary of me, he would have been tired of me long before 
now. If he had not loved me with a love as deep as hell, and as strong 
as death, he would have turned from me long ago. Oh, joy above all 
joys, to know that I am his everlasting and inalienable inheritance, 
given to him by his Father or ever the earth was! Everlasting love 
shall be the pillow for my head this night.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0228am-p3">It is the believer’s privilege to use this language. If he is looking for aught from 
the world, it is a poor “expectation” indeed. But if he looks to God for the supply of his wants, whether 
in temporal or spiritual blessings, his “expectation” will not be a vain one. Constantly he may draw from the bank of faith, 
and get his need supplied out of the riches of God’s lovingkindness. This I know, I had rather have God for my banker 
than all the Rothschilds. My Lord never fails to honour his promises; 
and when we bring them to his throne, he never sends them back unanswered. 
Therefore I will wait only at his door, for he ever opens it with 
the hand of munificent grace. At this hour I will try him anew. But 
we have “expectations” beyond this life. We shall die soon; and then our “expectation is from him.” Do we not expect that when we lie upon the bed of sickness he will 
send angels to carry us to his bosom? We believe that when the pulse 
is faint, and the heart heaves heavily, some angelic messenger shall 
stand and look with loving eyes upon us, and whisper, “Sister spirit, come away!” As we approach the heavenly gate, we expect to hear the welcome invitation, 
“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you 
from the foundation of the world.” We are expecting harps of gold and crowns of glory; we are hoping 
soon to be amongst the multitude of shining ones before the throne; 
we are looking forward and longing for the time when we shall be like 
our glorious Lord—for “We shall see him as he is.” Then if these be thine “expectations,” O my soul, live for God; live with the desire and resolve to glorify 
him from whom cometh all thy supplies, and of whose grace in thy election, 
redemption, and calling, it is that thou hast any “expectation” of coming glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0228pm-p3">See the faithfulness of divine love. You observe that this woman had 
daily necessities. She had herself and her son to feed in a time of 
famine; and now, in addition, the prophet Elijah was to be fed too. 
But though the need was threefold, yet the supply of meal wasted not, 
for she had a <i>constant supply</i>. Each day she made calls upon the barrel, but yet each day it remained 
the same. You, dear reader, have daily necessities, and because they 
come so frequently, you are apt to fear that the barrel of meal will 
one day be empty, and the cruse of oil will fail you. Rest assured 
that, according to the Word of God, this shall not be the case. Each 
day, though it bring its trouble, shall bring its help; and though 
you should live to outnumber the years of Methuselah, and though your 
needs should be as many as the sands of the seashore, yet shall God’s grace and mercy last through all your necessities, and you shall 
never know a real lack. For three long years, in this widow’s days, the heavens never saw a cloud, and the stars never wept a 
holy tear of dew upon the wicked earth: famine, and desolation, and 
death, made the land a howling wilderness, but this woman never was 
hungry, but always joyful in abundance. So shall it be with you. You 
shall see the sinner’s hope perish, for he trusts his native strength; you shall see the 
proud Pharisee’s confidence totter, for he builds his hope upon the sand; you shall 
see even your own schemes blasted and withered, but you yourself shall 
find that your place of defence shall be the munition of rocks: “Your bread shall be given you, and your water shall be sure.” Better have God for your guardian, than the Bank of England for your 
possession. You might spend the wealth of the Indies, but the infinite 
riches of God you can never exhaust.</p>

bring us to Christ; but the final victory is effected by lovingkindness. 
The prodigal set out to his father’s house from a sense of need; but his father saw him a great way off, 
and ran to meet him; so that the last steps he took towards his father’s house were with the kiss still warm upon his cheek, and the welcome 
still musical in his ears.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0229am-p4">The Master came one night to the door, and knocked with the iron hand 
of the law; the door shook and trembled upon its hinges; but the man 
piled every piece of furniture which he could find against the door, 
for he said, “I will not admit the man.” The Master turned away, but by-and-bye he came back, and with his 
own soft hand, using most that part where the nail had penetrated, 
he knocked again—oh, so softly and tenderly. This time the door did not shake, but, 
strange to say, it opened, and there upon his knees the once unwilling 
host was found rejoicing to receive his guest. “Come in, come in; thou hast so knocked that my bowels are moved for 
thee. I could not think of thy pierced hand leaving its blood-mark 
on my door, and of thy going away houseless, ‘Thy head filled with dew, and thy locks with the drops of the night.’ I yield, I yield, thy love has won my heart.” So in every case: lovingkindness wins the day. What Moses with the 
tablets of stone could never do, Christ does with his pierced hand. 
Such is the doctrine of effectual calling. Do I understand it experimentally? 
Can I say, “He drew me, and I followed on, glad to confess the voice divine?” If so, may he continue to draw me, till at last I shall sit down 
at the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0229pm-p3">Dear reader, have you received the spirit which is of God, wrought 
by the Holy Ghost in your soul? The necessity of the work of the Holy 
Spirit in the heart may be clearly seen from this fact, that <i>all which has been done by God the Father, and</i> <i>by God the Son, must be ineffectual to us, unless the Spirit</i> <i>shall reveal these things to our souls</i>. What effect does the doctrine of election have upon any man until 
the Spirit of God enters into him? Election is a dead letter in my 
consciousness until the Spirit of God calls me out of darkness into 
marvellous light. <i>Then</i> through my calling, I see my election, and knowing myself to be called 
of God, I know myself to have been chosen in the eternal purpose. 
A covenant was made with the Lord Jesus Christ, by his Father; but 
what avails that covenant to us until the Holy Spirit brings us its 
blessings, and opens our hearts to receive them? There hang the blessings 
on the nail—Christ Jesus; but being short of stature, we cannot reach them; the 
Spirit of God takes them down and hands them to us, and thus they 
become actually ours. Covenant blessings in themselves are like the 
manna in the skies, far out of mortal reach, but the Spirit of God 
opens the windows of heaven and scatters the living bread around the 
camp of the spiritual Israel. Christ’s finished work is like wine stored in the wine-vat; through unbelief 
we can neither draw nor drink. The Holy Spirit dips our vessel into 
this precious wine, and then we drink; but without the Spirit we are 
as truly dead in sin as though the Father never had elected, and though 
the Son had never bought us with his blood. The Holy Spirit is absolutely 
necessary to our well-being. Let us walk lovingly towards him and 
tremble at the thought of grieving him.</p>

to the drawing forth of the perfume of our graces. So long as it cannot 
be said, “The Lord was not in the wind,” we will not shrink from the most wintry blast that ever blew upon 
plants of grace. Did not the spouse in this verse humbly submit herself 
to the reproofs of her Beloved; only entreating him to send forth 
his grace in some form, and making no stipulation as to the peculiar 
manner in which it should come? Did she not, like ourselves, become 
so utterly weary of deadness and unholy calm that she sighed for any 
visitation which would brace her to action? Yet she desires the warm 
south wind of comfort, too, the smiles of divine love, the joy of 
the Redeemer’s presence; these are often mightily effectual to arouse our sluggish 
life. She desires either one or the other, or both; so that she may 
but be able to delight her Beloved with the spices of her garden. 
She cannot endure to be unprofitable, nor can we. How cheering a thought 
that Jesus can find comfort in our poor feeble graces. Can it be? 
It seems far too good to be true. Well may we court trial or even 
death itself if we shall thereby be aided to make glad Immanuel’s heart. O that our heart were crushed to atoms if only by such bruising 
our sweet Lord Jesus could be glorified. Graces unexercised are as 
sweet perfumes slumbering in the cups of the flowers: the wisdom of 
the great Husbandman overrules diverse and opposite causes to produce 
the one desired result, and makes both affliction and consolation 
draw forth the grateful odours of faith, love, patience, hope, resignation, 
joy, and the other fair flowers of the garden. May we know by sweet 
experience, what this means.</p>

Beloved. The glances of his eyes outshine the sun: the beauties of 
his face are fairer than the choicest flowers: no fragrance is like 
the breath of his mouth. Gems of the mine, and pearls from the sea, 
are worthless things when measured by his preciousness. Peter tells 
us that Jesus is precious, but he did not and could not tell us <i>how</i> precious, nor could any of us compute the value of God’s unspeakable gift. Words cannot set forth the preciousness of the 
Lord Jesus to his people, nor fully tell how essential he is to their 
satisfaction and happiness. Believer, have you not found in the midst 
of plenty a sore famine if your Lord has been absent? The sun was 
shining, but Christ had hidden himself, and all the world was black 
to you; or it was night, and since the bright and morning star was 
gone, no other star could yield you so much as a ray of light. What 
a howling wilderness is this world without our Lord! If once he hideth 
himself from us, withered are the flowers of our garden; our pleasant 
fruits decay; the birds suspend their songs, and a tempest overturns 
our hopes. All earth’s candles cannot make daylight if the Sun of Righteousness be eclipsed. 
He is the soul of our soul, the light of our light, the life of our 
life. Dear reader, what wouldst thou do in the world without him, 
when thou wakest up and lookest forward to the day’s battle? What wouldst thou do at night, when thou comest home jaded 
and weary, if there were no door of fellowship between thee and Christ? 
Blessed be his name, he will not suffer us to try our lot without 
him, for Jesus never forsakes his own. Yet, let the thought of <i>what life would be without him</i> enhance his preciousness.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0302am-p3">We are engaged in a great war with the Philistines of evil. <i>Every weapon within our reach must be used</i>. Preaching, teaching, praying, giving, all must be brought into action, 
and talents which have been thought too mean for service, must now 
be employed. Coulter, and axe, and mattock, may all be useful in slaying 
Philistines; rough tools may deal hard blows, and killing need not 
be elegantly done, so long as it is done effectually. Each moment 
of time, in season or out of season; each fragment of ability, educated 
or untutored; each opportunity, favourable or unfavourable, must be 
used, for our foes are many and our force but slender.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0302am-p4"><i>Most of our tools want sharpening</i>; we need quickness of perception, tact, energy, promptness, in a

of Christian enterprises. We might learn from our enemies if we would, 
and so <i>make the</i> <i>Philistines sharpen our weapons</i>. This morning let us note enough to sharpen our zeal during this 
day by the aid of the Holy Spirit. See the energy of the Papists, 
how they compass sea and land to make one proselyte, are they to monopolize 
all the earnestness? Mark the heathen devotees, what tortures they 
endure in the service of their idols! are they alone to exhibit patience 
and self-sacrifice? Observe the prince of darkness, how persevering 
in his endeavours, how unabashed in his attempts, how daring in his 
plans, how thoughtful in his plots, how energetic in all! The devils 
are united as one man in their infamous rebellion, while we believers 
in Jesus are divided in our service of God, and scarcely ever work 
with unanimity. O that from Satan’s infernal industry we may learn to go about like good Samaritans, 
seeking whom we may bless!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0302pm-p3">The apostle Paul felt it a great privilege to be allowed to preach 
the gospel. He did not look upon his calling as a drudgery, but he 
entered upon it with intense delight. Yet while Paul was thus thankful 
for his office, his success in it greatly humbled him. The fuller 
a vessel becomes, the deeper it sinks in the water. Idlers may indulge 
a fond conceit of their abilities, because they are untried; but the 
earnest worker soon learns his own weakness. If you seek humility, 
<i>try hard work</i>; if you would know your nothingness, attempt some great thing for 
Jesus. If you would feel how utterly powerless you are apart from 
the living God, attempt especially the great work of proclaiming the 
unsearchable riches of Christ, and you will know, as you never knew 
before, what a weak unworthy thing you are. Although the apostle thus 
knew and confessed his weakness, he was never perplexed as to the 
<i>subject</i> of his ministry. From his first sermon to his last, Paul preached 
Christ, and nothing but Christ. He lifted up the cross, and extolled 
the Son of God who bled thereon. Follow his example in all your personal 
efforts to spread the glad tidings of salvation, and let “Christ and him crucified” be your ever recurring theme. The Christian should be like those 
lovely spring flowers which, when the sun is shining, open their golden 
cups, as if saying, “Fill us with thy beams!” but when the sun is hidden behind a cloud, they close their cups 
and droop their heads. So should the Christian feel the sweet influence 
of Jesus; Jesus must be his sun, and he must be the flower which yields 
itself to the Sun of Righteousness. Oh! to speak of Christ alone, 
this is the subject which is both “seed for the sower, and bread for the eater.” This is the live coal for the lip of the speaker, and the master-key 
to the heart of the hearer.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0303am-p3">Comfort thyself, tried believer, with this thought: God saith, “I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.” Does not the word come like a soft shower, assuaging the fury of 
the flame? Yea, is it not an asbestos armour, against which the heat 
hath no power? Let affliction come—God has chosen me. Poverty, thou mayst stride in at my door, but God 
is in the house already, and he has chosen me. Sickness, thou mayst 
intrude, but I have a balsam ready—God has chosen me. Whatever befalls me in this vale of tears, I know 
that he has “chosen” me. If, believer, thou requirest still greater comfort, remember 
<i>that</i> <i>you have the Son of Man with you in the furnace</i>. In that silent chamber of yours, there sitteth by your side One 
whom thou hast not seen, but whom thou lovest; and ofttimes when thou 
knowest it not, he makes all thy bed in thy affliction, and smooths 
thy pillow for thee. Thou art in poverty; but in that lovely house 
of thine the Lord of life and glory is a frequent visitor. He loves 
to come into these desolate places, that he may visit thee. Thy friend 
sticks closely to thee. Thou canst not see him, but thou mayst feel 
the pressure of his hands. Dost thou not hear his voice? Even in the 
valley of the shadow of death he says, “Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God.” Remember that noble speech of Caesar: “Fear not, thou carriest Caesar and all his fortune.” Fear not, Christian; Jesus is with thee. In all thy fiery trials, 
his presence is both thy comfort and safety. He will never leave one 
whom he has chosen for his own. “Fear not, for I am with thee,” is his sure word of promise to his chosen ones in the “furnace of affliction.” Wilt thou not, then, take fast hold of Christ, and say—</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0303pm-p3">As the Spirit of God descended upon the Lord Jesus, the head, so he 
also, in measure, descends upon the members of the mystical body. 
His descent is to us after the same fashion as that in which it fell 
upon our Lord. There is often a singular <i>rapidity</i> about it; or ever we are aware, we are impelled onward and heavenward 
beyond all expectation. Yet is there none of the hurry of earthly 
haste, for the wings of the dove are as soft as they are swift. <i>Quietness</i> seems essential to many spiritual operations; the Lord is in the 
still small voice, and like the dew, his grace is distilled in silence. 
The dove has ever been the chosen type of <i>purity</i>, and the Holy Spirit is holiness itself. Where he cometh, everything 
that is pure and lovely, and of good report, is made to abound, and 
sin and uncleanness depart. <i>Peace</i> reigns also where the Holy Dove comes with power; he bears the olive 
branch which shows that the waters of divine wrath are assuaged. <i>Gentleness</i> is a sure result of the Sacred Dove’s transforming power: hearts touched by his benign influence are meek 
and lowly henceforth and forever. <i>Harmlessness</i> follows, as a matter of course; eagles and ravens may hunt their 
prey—the turtledove can endure wrong, but cannot inflict it. We must be 
harmless as doves. The dove is an apt picture of <i>love</i>, the voice of the turtle is full of affection; and so, the soul visited 
by the blessed Spirit, abounds in love to God, in love to the brethren, 
and in love to sinners; and above all, in love to Jesus. The brooding 
of the Spirit of God upon the face of the deep, first produced <i>order</i> <i>and life</i>, and in our hearts, he causes and fosters new life and light. Blessed 
Spirit, as thou didst rest upon our dear Redeemer, even so rest upon 
us from this time forward and forever.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0304am-p3">If none of God’s saints were poor and tried, we should not know half so well the 
consolations of divine grace. When we find the wanderer who has not 
where to lay his head, who yet can say, “Still will I trust in the Lord;” when we see the pauper starving on bread and water, who still glories 
in Jesus; when we see the bereaved widow overwhelmed in affliction, 
and yet having faith in Christ, oh! what honour it reflects on the 
gospel. God’s grace is illustrated and magnified in the poverty and trials of 
believers. Saints bear up under every discouragement, believing that 
all things work together for their good, and that out of apparent 
evils a real blessing shall ultimately spring—that their God will either work a deliverance for them speedily, or 
most assuredly support them in the trouble, as long as he is pleased 
to keep them in it. This patience of the saints proves the power of 
divine grace. There is a lighthouse out at sea: it is a calm night—I cannot tell whether the edifice is firm; the tempest must rage about 
it, and then I shall know whether it will stand. So with the Spirit’s work: if it were not on many occasions surrounded with tempestuous 
waters, we should not know that it was true and strong; if the winds 
did not blow upon it, we should not know how firm and secure it was. 
The master-works of God are those men who stand in the midst of difficulties, 
stedfast, unmoveable,—</p>

it, because you will the better show forth the all-sufficient grace 
of God. As for his failing you, never dream of it—hate the thought. The God who has been sufficient until now, should 
be trusted to the end.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0304pm-p3">Sheba’s queen was amazed at the sumptuousness of Solomon’s table. She lost all heart when she saw the provision of a single 
day; and she marvelled equally at the company of servants who were 
feasted at the royal board. But what is this to the hospitalities 
of the God of grace? Ten thousand thousand of his people are daily 
fed; hungry and thirsty, they bring large appetites with them to the 
banquet, but not one of them returns unsatisfied; there is enough 
for each, enough for all, enough for evermore. Though the host that 
feed at Jehovah’s table is countless as the stars of heaven, yet each one has his 
portion of meat. Think how much grace one saint requires, so much 
that nothing but the Infinite could supply him for one day; and yet 
the Lord spreads his table, not for one, but many saints, not for 
one day, but for many years; not for many years only, but for generation 
after generation. Observe the full feasting spoken of in the text, 
the guests at mercy’s banquet are satisfied, nay, more “abundantly satisfied;” and that not with ordinary fare, but with fatness, the peculiar fatness 
of God’s own house; and such feasting is guaranteed by a faithful promise 
to all those children of men who put their trust under the shadow 
of Jehovah’s wings. I once thought if I might but get the broken meat at God’s back door of grace I should be satisfied; like the woman who said, 
“The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master’s table;” but no child of God is ever served with scraps and leavings; like 
Mephibosheth, they all eat from the king’s own table. In matters of grace, we all have Benjamin’s mess—we all have ten times more than we could have expected, and though 
our necessities are great, yet are we often amazed at the marvellous 
plenty of grace which God gives us experimentally to enjoy.</p>

text informs me first of all that <i>David had</i> <i>his doubts</i>; for why should he pray, “Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation,” if he were not sometimes exercised with doubts and fears? Let me, 
then, be of good cheer, for I am not the only saint who has to complain 
of weakness of faith. If David doubted, I need not conclude that I 
am no Christian because I have doubts. The text reminds me that <i>David was not content</i> <i>while he had doubts and fears</i>, but he repaired at once to the mercy-seat to pray for assurance; 
for he valued it as much fine gold. I too must labour after an abiding 
sense of my acceptance in the Beloved, and must have no joy when his 
love is not shed abroad in my soul. When my Bridegroom is gone from 
me, my soul must and will fast. I learn also that <i>David knew where</i> <i>to obtain full assurance</i>. He went to his God in prayer, crying, “Say unto my soul I am thy salvation.” I must be much alone with God if I would have a clear sense of Jesus’ love. Let my prayers cease, and my eye of faith will grow dim. Much 
in prayer, much in heaven; slow in prayer, slow in progress. I notice 
that <i>David would not be satisfied unless his assurance</i> <i>had a divine source</i>. “Say unto my soul.” Lord, do <i>thou</i> say it! Nothing short of a divine testimony in the soul will ever 
content the true Christian. Moreover, David could not rest unless 
his assurance had <i>a vivid personality</i> about it. “Say unto <i>my</i> soul, I am <i>thy</i> salvation.” Lord, if thou shouldst say this to all the saints, it were nothing, 
unless thou shouldst say it to me. Lord, I have sinned; I deserve 
not thy smile; I scarcely dare to ask it; but oh! say to <i>my</i> soul, even to <i>my</i> soul, “I am <i>thy</i> salvation.” Let me have a present, personal, infallible, indisputable sense that 
I am thine, and that thou art mine.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0306am-p3">Regeneration is a subject which lies at the very basis of salvation, 
and we should be very diligent to take heed that we really are “born again,” for there are many who fancy they are, who are not. Be assured that 
the name of a Christian is not the nature of a Christian; and that 
being born in a Christian land, and being recognized as professing 
the Christian religion is of no avail whatever, unless there be something 
more added to it—the being “born again,” is a matter so <i>mysterious</i>, that human words cannot describe it. “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, 
but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every 
one that is born of the Spirit.” Nevertheless, it is a change which is <i>known and felt</i>: known by works of holiness, and felt by a gracious experience. This 
great work is <i>supernatural</i>. It is not an operation which a man performs for himself: a new principle 
is infused, which works in the heart, renews the soul, and affects 
the entire man. It is not a change of my name, but a renewal of my 
nature, so that I am not the man I used to be, but a new man in Christ 
Jesus. To wash and dress a corpse is a far different thing from making 
it alive: man can do the one, God alone can do the other. If you have 
then, been “born again,” your acknowledgment will be, “O Lord Jesus, the everlasting Father, thou art my spiritual Parent; 
unless thy Spirit had breathed into me the breath of a new, holy, 
and spiritual life, I had been to this day ‘dead in trespasses and sins.’ My heavenly life is wholly derived from thee, to thee I ascribe it. 
‘My life is hid with Christ in God.’ It is no longer I who live, but Christ who liveth in me.” May the Lord enable us to be well assured on this vital point, for 
to be unregenerate is to be unsaved, unpardoned, without God, and 
without hope.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0306pm-p3">It is an old and common saying, that “coming events cast their shadows before them;” the wise man teaches us that a haughty heart is the prophetic prelude 
of evil. Pride is as safely the sign of destruction as the change 
of mercury in the weather-glass is the sign of rain; and far more 
infallibly so than that. When men have ridden the high horse, destruction 
has always overtaken them. Let David’s aching heart show that there is an eclipse of a man’s glory when he dotes upon his own greatness. <scripRef passage="2Sa 24:10" id="d0306pm-p3.1" parsed="|2Sam|24|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.24.10">2 Sam. 24:10</scripRef>. See Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty builder of Babylon, creeping on the 
earth, devouring grass like oxen, until his nails had grown like bird’s claws, and his hair like eagle’s feathers. <scripRef passage="Da 4:33" id="d0306pm-p3.2" parsed="|Dan|4|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.4.33">Dan. 4:33</scripRef>. Pride made the boaster a beast, as once before it made an angel 
a devil. God hates high looks, and never fails to bring them down. 
All the arrows of God are aimed at proud hearts. O Christian, is thine 
heart haughty this evening? For pride can get into the Christian’s heart as well as into the sinner's; it can delude him into dreaming 
that he is “rich and increased in goods, and hath need of nothing.” Art thou glorying in thy graces or thy talents? Art thou proud of 
thyself, that thou hast had holy frames and sweet experiences? Mark 
thee, reader, there is a destruction coming to thee also. Thy flaunting 
poppies of self-conceit will be pulled up by the roots, thy mushroom 
graces will wither in the burning heat, and thy self-sufficiency shall 
become as straw for the dunghill. If we forget to live at the foot 
of the cross in deepest lowliness of spirit, God will not forget to 
make us smart under his rod. A destruction will come to thee, O unduly 
exalted believer, the destruction of thy joys and of thy comforts, 
though there can be no destruction of thy soul. Wherefore, “He that glorieth, let him glory <i>in the Lord</i>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0307am-p3">Faith is the foot of the soul by which it can march along the road 
of the commandments. Love can make the feet move more swiftly; but 
faith is the foot which carries the soul. Faith is the oil enabling 
the wheels of holy devotion and of earnest piety to move well; and 
without faith the wheels are taken from the chariot, and we drag heavily. 
With faith I can do all things; without faith I shall neither have 
the inclination nor the power to do anything in the service of God. 
If you would find the men who serve God the best, you must look for 
the men of the most faith. Little faith will save a man, but little 
faith cannot do great things for God. Poor Little-faith could not 
have fought “Apollyon;” it needed “Christian” to do that. Poor Little-faith could not have slain “Giant Despair;” it required “Great-heart's” arm to knock that monster down. Little faith will go to heaven most 
certainly, but it often has to hide itself in a nut-shell, and it 
frequently loses all but its jewels. Little-faith says, “It is a rough road, beset with sharp thorns, and full of dangers; 
I am afraid to go;” but Great-faith remembers the promise, “Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; as thy days, so shall thy strength 
be:” and so she boldly ventures. Little-faith stands desponding, mingling 
her tears with the flood; but Great-faith sings, “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through 
the rivers, they shall not overflow thee:” and she fords the stream at once. Would you be comfortable and happy? 
Would you enjoy religion? Would you have the religion of cheerfulness 
and not that of gloom? Then “have faith in God.” If you love darkness, and are satisfied to dwell in gloom and misery, 
then be content with little faith; but if you love the sunshine, and 
would sing songs of rejoicing, covet earnestly this best gift, “great faith.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0307pm-p3">Doubtless the reader has been tried with the temptation to rely upon 
the things which are seen, instead of resting alone upon the invisible 
God. Christians often look to man for help and counsel, and mar the 
noble simplicity of their reliance upon their God. Does this evening’s portion meet the eye of a child of God anxious about temporals, 
then would we reason with him awhile. You trust in Jesus, and only 
in Jesus, for your salvation, then why are you troubled? “<i>Because of my great</i> <i>care</i>.” Is it not written, “Cast thy burden upon the Lord”? “Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication 
make known your wants unto God.” Cannot you trust God for temporals? “<i>Ah! I wish I could</i>.” If you cannot trust God for temporals, how dare you trust him for 
spirituals? Can you trust him for your soul’s redemption, and not rely upon him for a few lesser mercies? Is not 
God enough for thy need, or is his all-sufficiency too narrow for 
thy wants? Dost thou want another eye beside that of him who sees 
every secret thing? Is his heart faint? Is his arm weary? If so, seek 
another God; but if he be infinite, omnipotent, faithful, true, and 
all-wise, why gaddest thou abroad so much to seek another confidence? 
Why dost thou rake the earth to find another foundation, when this 
is strong enough to bear all the weight which thou canst ever build 
thereon? Christian, mix not only thy wine with water, do not alloy 
thy gold of faith with the dross of human confidence. Wait thou only 
upon God, and let thine expectation be from him. Covet not Jonah’s gourd, but rest in Jonah’s God. Let the sandy foundations of terrestrial trust be the choice 
of fools, but do thou, like one who foresees the storm, build for 
thyself an abiding place upon the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0308am-p3">God’s people have their trials. It was never designed by God, when he 
chose his people, that they should be an untried people. They were 
chosen in the furnace of affliction; they were never chosen to worldly 
peace and earthly joy. Freedom from sickness and the pains of mortality 
was never promised them; but when their Lord drew up the charter of 
privileges, he included chastisements amongst the things to which 
they should inevitably be heirs. Trials are a part of our lot; they 
were predestinated for us in Christ’s last legacy. So surely as the stars are fashioned by his hands, 
and their orbits fixed by him, so surely are our trials allotted to 
us: he has ordained their season and their place, their intensity 
and the effect they shall have upon us. Good men must never expect 
to escape troubles; if they do, they will be disappointed, for none 
of their predecessors have been without them. Mark the patience of 
Job; remember Abraham, for he had his trials, and by his faith under 
them, he became the “Father of the faithful.” Note well the biographies of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, 
and martyrs, and you shall discover none of those whom God made vessels 
of mercy, who were not made to pass through the fire of affliction. 
It is ordained of old that the cross of trouble should be engraved 
on every vessel of mercy, as the royal mark whereby the King’s vessels of honour are distinguished. But although tribulation is 
thus the path of God’s children, they have the comfort of knowing that their Master has 
traversed it before them; they have his presence and sympathy to cheer 
them, his grace to support them, and his example to teach them how 
to endure; and when they reach “the kingdom,” it will more than make amends for the “much tribulation” through which they passed to enter it.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0308pm-p3">To every matter there is a bright as well as a dark side. Rachel was 
overwhelmed with the sorrow of her own travail and death; Jacob, though 
weeping the mother’s loss, could see the mercy of the child’s birth. It is well for us if, while the flesh mourns over trials, 
our faith triumphs in divine faithfulness. Samson’s lion yielded honey, and so will our adversities, if rightly considered. 
The stormy sea feeds multitudes with its fishes; the wild wood blooms 
with beauteous flowerets; the stormy wind sweeps away the pestilence, 
and the biting frost loosens the soil. Dark clouds distil bright drops, 
and black earth grows gay flowers. A vein of good is to be found in 
every mine of evil. Sad hearts have peculiar skill in discovering 
the most disadvantageous point of view from which to gaze upon a trial; 
if there were only one slough in the world, they would soon be up 
to their necks in it, and if there were only one lion in the desert 
they would hear it roar. About us all there is a tinge of this wretched 
folly, and we are apt, at times, like Jacob, to cry, “All these things are against me.” Faith’s way of walking is to cast all care upon the Lord, and then to anticipate 
good results from the worst calamities. Like Gideon’s men, she does not fret over the broken pitcher, but rejoices that 
the lamp blazes forth the more. Out of the rough oyster-shell of difficulty 
she extracts the rare pearl of honour, and from the deep ocean-caves 
of distress she uplifts the priceless coral of experience. When her 
flood of prosperity ebbs, she finds treasures hid in the sands; and 
when her sun of delight goes down, she turns her telescope of hope 
to the starry promises of heaven. When death itself appears, faith 
points to the light of resurrection beyond the grave, thus making 
our dying Ben-oni to be our living Benjamin.</p>

to be admired as to be loved. He is more than pleasant and fair, he 
is lovely. Surely the people of God can fully justify the use of this 
golden word, for he is the object of their warmest love, a love founded 
on the intrinsic excellence of his person, the complete perfection 
of his charms. Look, O disciples of Jesus, to your Master’s lips, and say, “Are they not most sweet?” Do not his words cause your hearts to burn within you as he talks 
with you by the way? Ye worshippers of Immanuel, look up to his head 
of much fine gold, and tell me, are not his thoughts precious unto 
you? Is not your adoration sweetened with affection as ye humbly bow 
before that countenance which is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars? 
Is there not a charm in his every feature, and is not his whole person 
fragrant with such a savour of his good ointments, that therefore 
the virgins love him? Is there one member of his glorious body which 
is not attractive?—one portion of his person which is not a fresh lodestone to our souls?—one office which is not a strong cord to bind your heart? Our love 
is not as a seal set upon his heart of love alone; it is fastened 
upon his arm of power also; nor is there a single part of him upon 
which it does not fix itself. We anoint his whole person with the 
sweet spikenard of our fervent love. His whole life we would imitate; 
his whole character we would transcribe. In all other beings we see 
some lack, in him there is all perfection. The best even of his favoured 
saints have had blots upon their garments and wrinkles upon their 
brows; he is nothing but loveliness. All earthly suns have their spots: 
the fair world itself hath its wilderness; we cannot love the whole 
of the most lovely thing; but Christ Jesus is gold without alloy-light 
without darkness—glory without cloud—“Yea, he is <i>altogether</i> lovely.”</p>

road before thee: see, O traveller to heaven, that thou go not without 
thy guide. Thou hast to pass through the fiery furnace; enter it not

the iron gates of death shall open to thee. Keep thou close to thy 
soul’s Husband, lean thy head upon his bosom, ask to be refreshed with 
the spiced wine of his pomegranate, and thou shalt be found of him 
at the last, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Seeing thou 
hast lived with him, and lived in him here, thou shalt abide with 
him forever.</p>

boasting like the Psalmist in our morning’s portion. “My mountain standeth firm: I shall never be moved.” It may stay us from taking too deep root in this soil from which 
we are so soon to be transplanted into the heavenly garden. Let us 
recollect the frail tenure upon which we hold our <i>temporal mercies</i>. If we would remember that all the trees of earth are marked for 
the woodman’s axe, we should not be so ready to build our nests in them. We should 
love, but we should love with the love which expects death, and which 
reckons upon separations. Our dear relations are but loaned to us, 
and the hour when we must return them to the lender’s hand may be even at the door. The like is certainly true of our 
<i>worldly</i> <i>goods</i>. Do not riches take to themselves wings and fly away? Our <i>health</i> is equally precarious. Frail flowers of the field, we must not reckon 
upon blooming forever. There is a time appointed for weakness and 
sickness, when we shall have to glorify God by suffering, and not 
by earnest activity. There is no single point in which we can hope 
to escape from the sharp arrows of affliction; out of our few days 
there is not one secure from sorrow. Man’s life is a cask full of bitter wine; he who looks for joy in it had 
better seek for honey in an ocean of brine. Beloved reader, set not 
your affections upon things of earth: but seek those things which 
are above, for <i>here</i> the moth devoureth, and the thief breaketh through, but <i>there</i> all joys are perpetual and eternal. The path of trouble is the way 
home. Lord, make this thought a pillow for many a weary head!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0311am-p3">Beware of light thoughts of sin. At the time of conversion, the conscience 
is so tender, that we are afraid of the slightest sin. Young converts 
have a holy timidity, a godly fear lest they should offend against 
God. But alas! very soon the fine bloom upon these first ripe fruits 
is removed by the rough handling of the surrounding world: the sensitive 
plant of young piety turns into a willow in after life, too pliant, 
too easily yielding. It is sadly true, that even a Christian may grow 
by degrees so callous, that the sin which once startled him does not 
alarm him in the least. By degrees men get familiar with sin. The 
ear in which the cannon has been booming will not notice slight sounds. 
At first a little sin startles us; but soon we say, “Is it not a little one?” Then there comes another, larger, and then another, until by degrees 
we begin to regard sin as but a little ill; and then follows an unholy 
presumption: “We have not fallen into open sin. True, we tripped a little, but we 
stood upright in the main. We may have uttered one unholy word, but 
as for the most of our conversation, it has been consistent.” So we palliate sin; we throw a cloak over it; we call it by dainty 
names. Christian, beware how thou thinkest lightly of sin. Take heed 
lest thou fall by little and little. Sin, a <i>little</i> thing? Is it not a poison? Who knows its deadliness? Sin, a little 
thing? Do not the little foxes spoil the grapes? Doth not the tiny 
coral insect build a rock which wrecks a navy? Do not little strokes 
fell lofty oaks? Will not continual droppings wear away stones? Sin, 
a little thing? It girded the Redeemer’s head with thorns, and pierced his heart! It made him suffer anguish, 
bitterness, and woe. Could you weigh the least sin in the scales of 
eternity, you would fly from it as from a serpent, and abhor the least 
appearance of evil. Look upon all sin as that which crucified the 
Saviour, and you will see it to be “exceeding sinful.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0311pm-p3">The surpassing grace of God is seen very clearly in that we were not 
only sought, but sought <i>out</i>. Men <i>seek</i> for a thing which is lost upon the floor of the house, but in such 
a case there is only seeking, not seeking out. The loss is more perplexing 
and the search more persevering when a thing is sought <i>out</i>. We were mingled with the mire: we were as when some precious piece 
of gold falls into the sewer, and men gather out and carefully inspect 
a mass of abominable filth, and continue to stir and rake, and search 
among the heap until the treasure is found. Or, to use another figure, 
we were lost in a labyrinth; we wandered hither and thither, and when 
mercy came after us with the gospel, it did not find us at the first 
coming, it had to search for us and seek us out; for we as lost sheep 
were so desperately lost, and had wandered into such a strange country, 
that it did not seem possible that even the Good Shepherd should track 
our devious roamings. Glory be to unconquerable grace, we were sought 
<i>out</i>! No gloom could hide us, no filthiness could conceal us, we were 
found and brought home. Glory be to infinite love, God the Holy Spirit 
restored us!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0311pm-p4">The lives of some of God’s people, if they could be written would fill us with holy astonishment. 
Strange and marvellous are the ways which God used in their case to 
find his own. Blessed be his name, he never relinquishes the search 
until the chosen are sought out effectually. They are not a people 
sought today and cast away to-morrow. Almightiness and wisdom combined 
will make no failures, they shall be called, “<i>Sought out</i>!” That any should be sought out is matchless grace, but that <i>we</i> should be sought out is grace beyond degree! We can find no reason 
for it but God’s own sovereign love, and can only lift up our heart in wonder, and 
praise the Lord that this night we wear the name of “<i>Sought out</i>.”</p>

little cot side-by-side with his lordly mansion; thou seest every day his estates, his fine 
linen, and his sumptuous banquets; God has given him these gifts, 
covet not his wealth, and think no hard thoughts concerning him. Be 
content with thine own lot, if thou canst not better it, but do not 
look upon thy neighbour, and wish that he were as thyself. Love him, 
and then thou wilt not envy him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0312am-p4">Perhaps, on the other hand, thou art rich, and near thee reside the 
poor. Do not scorn to call them neighbour. Own that thou art bound 
to love them. The world calls them thy inferiors. In what are they 
inferior? They are far more thine equals than thine inferiors, for 
“God hath made of one blood all people that dwell upon the face of 
the earth.” It is thy coat which is better than theirs, but thou art by no means 
better than they. They are men, and what art thou more than that? 
Take heed that thou love thy neighbour even though he be in rags, 
or sunken in the depths of poverty.</p>

who dares the most, shall win the most; and if rough be thy path of 
love, tread it boldly, still loving thy neighbours through thick and 
thin. Heap coals of fire on their heads, and if they be hard to please, 
seek not to please <i>them</i>, but to please <i>thy</i> <i>Master</i>; and remember if <i>they</i> spurn thy love, thy Master hath not spurned it, and thy deed is as 
acceptable to him as if it had been acceptable to them. Love thy neighbour,

You belong to the Son of God, then <i>trust him</i>; rest nowhere but on him. You belong to the King of kings, then <i>be decided for him</i>. Thus, without your being branded upon the brow, all will know to

<p class="normal" id="d0313am-p3">Dear reader, this little book was mainly intended for the edification 
of believers, but if you are yet unsaved, our heart yearns over you: 
and we would fain say a word which may be blessed to you. Open your 
Bible, and read the story of the lepers, and mark their position, 
which was much the same as yours. If you remain where you are you 
must perish; if you go to Jesus you can but die. “Nothing venture, nothing win,” is the old proverb, and in your case the venture is no great one. 
If you sit still in sullen despair, no one can pity you when your 
ruin comes; but if you die with mercy sought, if such a thing were 
possible, you would be the object of universal sympathy. None escape 
who refuse to look to Jesus; but you know that, at any rate, some 
are saved who believe in him, for certain of your own acquaintances 
have received mercy: then why not you? The Ninevites said, “Who can tell?” Act upon the same hope, and try the Lord’s mercy. To perish is so awful, that if there were but a straw to 
catch at, the instinct of self-preservation should lead you to stretch 
out your hand. We have thus been talking to you on your own unbelieving 
ground, we would now assure you, as from the Lord, that if you seek 
him he will be found of you. Jesus casts out none who come unto him. 
You shall not perish if you trust him; on the contrary, you shall 
find treasure far richer than the poor lepers gathered in Syria’s deserted camp. May the Holy Spirit embolden you to go at once, and 
you shall not believe in vain. When you are saved yourself, publish 
the good news to others. Hold not your peace; tell the King’s household first, and unite with them in fellowship; let the porter 
of the city, the minister, be informed of your discovery, and then 
proclaim the good news in every place. The Lord save thee ere the 
sun goes down this day.</p>

ark as her only resting place. How heavily she flies—she will drop—she will never reach the ark! But she struggles on. Noah has been 
looking out for his dove all day long, and is ready to receive her. 
She has just strength to reach the edge of the ark, she can hardly 
alight upon it, and is ready to drop, when Noah puts forth his hand 
and pulls her in unto him. Mark that: “<i>pulled her in unto him</i>.” She did not fly right in herself, but was too fearful, or too weary 
to do so. She flew as far as she could, and then he put forth his 
hand and pulled her in unto him. This act of mercy was shown to the 
wandering dove, and she was not chidden for her wanderings. Just as 
she was she was pulled into the ark. So you, seeking sinner, with 
all your sin, will be received. “Only return”—those are God’s two gracious words—“only return.” What! nothing else? No, “only return.” She had no olive branch in her mouth this time, nothing at all but 
just herself and her wanderings; but it is “only return,” and she does return, and Noah pulls her in. Fly, thou wanderer; fly 
thou fainting one, dove as thou art, though thou thinkest thyself 
to be black as the raven with the mire of sin, back, back to the Saviour. 
Every moment thou waitest does but increase thy misery; thine attempts 
to plume thyself and make thyself fit for Jesus are all vanity. Come 
thou to him just as thou art. “Return, thou backsliding Israel.” He does not say, “Return, thou <i>repenting</i> Israel” (there is such an invitation doubtless), but “thou <i>backsliding</i> one,” as a backslider with all thy backslidings about thee, Return, return, 
return! Jesus is waiting for thee! He will stretch forth his hand 
and “pull thee in”—in to himself, thy heart’s true home.</p>

grace. A man says, “I have great faith, I shall not fall; poor little faith may, but I 
never shall.” “I have fervent love,” says another, “I can stand, there is no danger of my going astray.” He who boasts of grace has little grace to boast of. Some who do 
this imagine that their graces can keep them, knowing not that the 
stream must flow constantly from the fountain head, or else the brook 
will soon be dry. If a continuous stream of oil comes not to the lamp, 
though it burn brightly today, it will smoke to-morrow, and noxious 
will be its scent. Take heed that thou gloriest not in thy graces, 
but let all thy glorying and confidence be in Christ and his strength, 
for only so canst thou be kept from falling. Be much more in prayer. 
Spend longer time in holy adoration. Read the Scriptures more earnestly 
and constantly. Watch your lives more carefully. Live nearer to God. 
Take the best examples for your pattern. Let your conversation be 
redolent of heaven. Let your hearts be perfumed with affection for 
men’s souls. So live that men may take knowledge of you that you have 
been with Jesus, and have learned of him; and when that happy day 
shall come, when he whom you love shall say, “Come up higher,” may it be your happiness to hear him say, “Thou hast fought a good fight, thou hast finished thy course, and 
henceforth there is laid up for thee a crown of righteousness which 
fadeth not away.” On, Christian, with care and caution! On, with holy fear and trembling! 
On, with faith and confidence in Jesus alone, and let your constant 
petition be, “Uphold me according to thy word.” He is able, and he alone, “To keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the 
presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”</p>

The road is very miry, it will be hard to pick your path so as not 
to soil your garments. This is a world of pitch; you will need to 
watch often, if in handling it you are to keep your hands clean. There 
is a robber at every turn of the road to rob you of your jewels; there 
is a temptation in every mercy; there is a snare in every joy; and 
if you ever reach heaven, it will be a miracle of divine grace to 
be ascribed entirely to your Father’s power. Be on your guard. When a man carries a bomb-shell in his 
hand, he should mind that he does not go near a candle; and you too 
must take care that you enter not into temptation. Even your common 
actions are edged tools; you must mind how you handle them. There 
is nothing in this world to foster a Christian’s piety, but everything to destroy it. How anxious should you be to 
look up to God, that <i>he</i> may keep you! Your prayer should be, “Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.” Having prayed, you must also watch; guarding every thought, word, 
and action, with holy jealousy. Do not expose yourselves unnecessarily; 
but if called to exposure, if you are bidden to go where the darts 
are flying, never venture forth without your shield; for if once the 
devil finds you without your buckler, he will rejoice that his hour 
of triumph is come, and will soon make you fall down wounded by his 
arrows. Though slain you cannot be; wounded you may be. “Be sober; be vigilant, danger may be in an hour when all seemeth securest 
to thee.” Therefore, take heed to thy ways, and watch unto prayer. No man ever 
fell into error through being too watchful. May the Holy Spirit guide 
us in all our ways; so shall they always please the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0315am-p3">Christ has grace without measure in himself, but he hath not retained 
it for himself. As the reservoir empties itself into the pipes, so 
hath Christ emptied out his grace for his people. “Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.” He seems only to have in order to dispense to us. He stands like 
the fountain, always flowing, but only running in order to supply 
the empty pitchers and the thirsty lips which draw nigh unto it. Like 
a tree, he bears sweet fruit, not to hang on boughs, but to be gathered 
by those who need. Grace, whether its work be to pardon, to cleanse, 
to preserve, to strengthen, to enlighten, to quicken, or to restore, 
is ever to be had from him freely and without price; nor is there 
one form of the work of grace which he has not bestowed upon his people. 
As the blood of the body, though flowing from the heart, belongs equally 
to every member, so the influences of grace are the inheritance of 
every saint united to the Lamb; and herein there is a sweet communion 
between Christ and his Church, inasmuch as they both receive the same 
grace. Christ is the head upon which the oil is first poured; but 
the same oil runs to the very skirts of the garments, so that the 
meanest saint has an unction of the same costly moisture as that which 
fell upon the head. This is true communion when the sap of grace flows 
from the stem to the branch, and when it is perceived that the stem 
itself is sustained by the very nourishment which feeds the branch. 
As we day by day receive grace from Jesus, and more constantly recognize 
it as coming from him, we shall behold him in communion with us, and 
enjoy the felicity of communion with him. Let us make daily use of 
our riches, and ever repair to him as to our own Lord in covenant, 
taking from him the supply of all we need with as much boldness as 
men take money from their own purse.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0315pm-p3">This is no unusual occurrence; it is the general rule of the moral 
universe that those men prosper who do their work with all their hearts, 
while those are almost certain to fail who go to their labour leaving 
half their hearts behind them. God does not give harvests to idle 
men except harvests of thistles, nor is he pleased to send wealth 
to those who will not dig in the field to find its hid treasure. It 
is universally confessed that if a man would prosper, he must be diligent 
in business. It is the same in religion as it is in other things. 
If you would prosper in your work for Jesus, let it be <i>heart</i> work, and let it be done with <i>all</i> your heart. Put as much force, energy, heartiness, and earnestness 
into religion as ever you do into business, for it deserves far more. 
The Holy Spirit helps our infirmities, but he does not encourage our 
idleness; he loves active believers. Who are the most useful men in 
the Christian church? The men who do what they undertake for God <i>with all their hearts</i>. Who are the most successful Sabbath-school teachers? The most talented? 
No; the most zealous; the men whose hearts are on fire, those are 
the men who see their Lord riding forth prosperously in the majesty 
of his salvation. Whole-heartedness shows itself in <i>perseverance</i>; there may be failure at first, but the earnest worker will say, 
“It is the Lord’s work, and it must be done; my Lord has bidden me do it, and in his 
strength I will accomplish it.” Christian, art thou thus “with all thine heart” serving thy Master? Remember the earnestness of Jesus! Think what 
heart-work was his! He could say, “<i>The zeal of</i> <i>thine house hath eaten me up</i>.” When he sweat great drops of blood, it was no light burden he had 
to carry upon those blessed shoulders; and when he poured out his 
heart, it was no weak effort he was making for the salvation of his 
people. Was Jesus in earnest, and are we lukewarm?</p>

sets up new laws and alien customs, and knows thee not. When thy dear

foreigner so speckled a bird among the denizens of any land as thy

a stranger in the land. My speech seems to these Babylonians among 
whom I dwell an outlandish tongue, my manners are singular, and my 
actions are strange. A Tartar would be more at home in Cheapside than 
I could ever be in the haunts of sinners. But here is the sweetness

<p class="normal" id="d0316pm-p3">Such was the <i>prayer of the “man after God’s own heart</i>.” Did holy David need to pray thus? How needful, then, must such a 
prayer be for us babes in grace! It is as if he said, “Keep me back, or I shall rush headlong over the precipice of sin.” Our evil nature, like an ill-tempered horse, is apt to run away. 
May the grace of God put the bridle upon it, and hold it in, that 
it rush not into mischief. What might not the best of us do if it 
were not for the checks which the Lord sets upon us both in providence 
and in grace! The psalmist’s prayer is directed against the worst form of sin—that which is done with deliberation and wilfulness. Even the holiest 
need to be “kept back” from the vilest transgressions. It is a solemn thing to find the 
apostle Paul warning saints against the most loathsome sins. “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, 
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, 
which is idolatry.” What! do saints want warning against such sins as these? Yes, they 
do. The whitest robes, unless their purity be preserved by divine 
grace, will be defiled by the blackest spots. Experienced Christian, 
boast not in your experience; you will trip yet if you look away from 
him who is able to keep you from falling. Ye whose love is fervent, 
whose faith is constant, whose hopes are bright, say not, “We shall never sin,” but rather cry, “Lead us not into temptation.” There is enough tinder in the heart of the best of men to light a 
fire that shall burn to the lowest hell, unless God shall quench the 
sparks as they fall. Who would have dreamed that righteous Lot could 
be found drunken, and committing uncleanness? Hazael said, “Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?” and we are very apt to use the same self-righteous question. May 
infinite wisdom cure us of the madness of self-confidence.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0317am-p3">Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make 
them all rich if he pleased; he could lay bags of gold at their doors; 
he could send them a large annual income; or he could scatter round 
their houses abundance of provisions, as once he made the quails lie 
in heaps round the camp of Israel, and rained bread out of heaven 
to feed them. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except 
that he sees it to be best. “The cattle upon a thousand hills are his”—he could supply them; he could make the richest, the greatest, and 
the mightiest bring all their power and riches to the feet of his 
children, for the hearts of all men are in his control. But he does 
not choose to do so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them 
to pine in penury and obscurity. Why is this? There are many reasons: 
one is, <i>to give us, who are favoured with</i> <i>enough, an opportunity of showing our love to Jesus</i>. We show our love to Christ when we sing of him and when we pray 
to him; but if there were no sons of need in the world we should lose 
the sweet privilege of evidencing our love, by ministering in alms-giving 
to his poorer brethren; he has ordained that thus we should prove 
that our love standeth not in word only, but in deed and in truth. 
If we truly love Christ, we shall care for those who are loved by 
him. Those who are dear to him will be dear to us. Let us then look 
upon it not as a duty but as a privilege to relieve the poor of the 
Lord’s flock—remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, 
ye have done it unto me.” Surely this assurance is sweet enough, and this motive strong enough 
to lead us to help others with a willing hand and a loving heart—recollecting that all we do for his people is graciously accepted 
by Christ as done to himself.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0317pm-p3">This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of 
perfection among the Hebrews. It may be that the Saviour placed the 
peacemaker the seventh upon the list because he most nearly approaches 
the perfect man in Christ Jesus. He who would have perfect blessedness, 
so far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must attain to this seventh 
benediction, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also 
in the position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of 
the blessedness of “the pure in heart: for they shall see God.” It is well to understand that we are to be “first pure, then peaceable.” Our peaceableness is never to be a compact with sin, or toleration 
of evil. We must set our faces like flints against everything which 
is contrary to God and his holiness: purity being in our souls a settled 
matter, we can go on to peaceableness. Not less does the verse that 
follows seem to have been put there on purpose. However peaceable 
we may be in this world, yet we shall be misrepresented and misunderstood: 
and no marvel, for even the Prince of Peace, by his very peacefulness, 
brought fire upon the earth. He himself, though he loved mankind, 
and did no ill, was “despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with 
grief.” Lest, therefore, the peaceable in heart should be surprised when 
they meet with enemies, it is added in the following verse, “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Thus, the peacemakers are not only pronounced to be blessed, but 
they are compassed about with blessings. Lord, give us grace to climb 
to this seventh beatitude! Purify our minds that we may be “first pure, then peaceable,” and fortify our souls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into 
cowardice and despair, when for thy sake we are persecuted.</p>

What is that divine method? He loved him <i>without</i> <i>beginning</i>, and thus Jesus loves his members. “<i>I have loved</i> <i>thee with an everlasting love</i>.” You can trace the beginning of human affection; you can easily find 
the beginning of your love to Christ, but his love to us is a stream 
whose source is hidden in eternity. God the Father loves Jesus <i>without any</i> <i>change</i>. Christian, take this for your comfort, that there is no change in 
Jesus Christ’s love to those who rest in him. Yesterday you were on Tabor’s top, and you said, “He loves me:” today you are in the valley of humiliation, but he loves you still 
the same. On the hill Mizar, and among the Hermons, you heard his 
voice, which spake so sweetly with the turtle-notes of love; and now 
on the sea, or even in the sea, when all his waves and billows go 
over you, his heart is faithful to his ancient choice. The Father 
loves the Son <i>without any end</i>, and thus does the Son love his people. Saint, thou needest not fear 
the loosing of the silver cord, for his love for thee will never cease. 
Rest confident that even down to the grave Christ will go with you, 
and that up again from it he will be your guide to the celestial hills. 
Moreover, the Father loves the Son <i>without</i> <i>any measure</i>, and the same immeasurable love the Son bestows upon his chosen ones. 
The whole heart of Christ is dedicated to his people. He “loved us and gave himself for us.” His is a love which passeth knowledge. Ah! we have indeed an immutable 
Saviour, a precious Saviour, one who loves without measure, without 
change, without beginning, and without end, even as the Father loves 
him! There is much food here for those who know how to digest it. 
May the Holy Ghost lead us into its marrow and fatness!</p>

Prayer cannot draw down answers from God’s throne except it be the earnest prayer of the man who believes. 
Faith is the angelic messenger between the soul and the Lord Jesus 
in glory. Let that angel be withdrawn, we can neither send up prayer, 
nor receive the answers. Faith is the telegraphic wire which links 
earth and heaven—on which God’s messages of love fly so fast, that before we call he answers, and 
while we are yet speaking he hears us. But if that telegraphic wire 
of faith be snapped, how can we receive the promise? Am I in trouble?—I can obtain help for trouble by faith. Am I beaten about by the enemy?—my soul on her dear Refuge leans by faith. But take faith away—in vain I call to God. There is no road betwixt my soul and heaven. 
In the deepest wintertime faith is a road on which the horses of prayer 
may travel—aye, and all the better for the biting frost; but blockade the road, 
and how can we communicate with the Great King? Faith links me with 
divinity. Faith clothes me with the power of God. Faith engages on 
my side the omnipotence of Jehovah. Faith ensures every attribute 
of God in my defence. It helps me to defy the hosts of hell. It makes 
me march triumphant over the necks of my enemies. But without faith 
how can I receive anything of the Lord? Let not him that wavereth—who is like a wave of the Sea—expect that he will receive anything of God! O, then, Christian, watch 
well thy faith; for with it thou canst win all things, however poor 
thou art, but without it thou canst obtain nothing. “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”</p>

our <i>hope</i> is satisfied, for whom have we in heaven but Jesus? and our desire 
is satiated, for what can we wish for more than “to know Christ and to be found in him?” Jesus fills our <i>conscience</i> till it is at perfect peace; our <i>judgment</i> with persuasion of the certainty of his teachings; our <i>memory</i> with recollections of what he has done, and our <i>imagination</i> with the prospects of what he is yet to do. As Ruth was “sufficed, <i>and left</i>,” so is it with us. We have had deep draughts; we have thought that 
we could take in all of Christ; but when we have done our best we 
have had to leave a vast remainder. We have sat at the table of the 
Lord’s love, and said, “Nothing but the infinite can ever satisfy me; I am such a great sinner 
that I must have infinite merit to wash my sin away;” but we have had our sin removed, and found that there was merit to 
spare; we have had our hunger relieved at the feast of sacred love, 
and found that there was a redundance of spiritual meat remaining. 
There are certain sweet things in the Word of God which we have not 
enjoyed yet, and which we are obliged to leave for awhile; for we 
are like the disciples to whom Jesus said, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.” Yes, there are graces to which we have not attained; places of fellowship 
nearer to Christ which we have not reached; and heights of communion 
which our feet have not climbed. At every banquet of love there are 
many baskets of fragments left. Let us magnify the liberality of our 
glorious Boaz.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0320am-p3">This was a golden name which the ancient Church in her most joyous 
moments was wont to give to the Anointed of the Lord. When the time 
of the singing of birds was come, and the voice of the turtle was 
heard in her land, <i>her</i> love-note was sweeter than either, as she sang, “<i>My beloved</i> is mine and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.” Ever in her song of songs doth she call him by that delightful name, 
“My beloved!” Even in the long winter, when idolatry had withered the garden of 
the Lord, her prophets found space to lay aside the burden of the 
Lord for a little season, and to say, as Esaias did, “Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his 
vineyard.” Though the saints had never seen his face, though as yet he was not 
made flesh, nor had dwelt among us, nor had man beheld his glory, 
yet he was the consolation of Israel, the hope and joy of all the 
chosen, the “beloved” of all those who were upright before the Most High. We, in the summer 
days of the Church, are also wont to speak of Christ as the best beloved 
of our soul, and to feel that he is very precious, the “chiefest among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely.” So true is it that the Church loves Jesus, and claims him as her 
beloved, that the apostle dares to defy the whole universe to separate 
her from the love of Christ, and declares that neither persecutions, 
distress, affliction, peril, or the sword have been able to do it; 
nay, he joyously boasts, “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved 
us.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0320pm-p3">What a golden example Christ gives to his disciples! Few masters could 
venture to say, “If you would practise my teaching, imitate my life;” but as the life of Jesus is the exact transcript of perfect virtue, 
he can point to himself as the paragon of holiness, as well as the 
teacher of it. The Christian should take nothing short of Christ for 
his model. Under no circumstances ought we to be content unless we 
reflect the grace which was in him. As a husband, the Christian is 
to look upon the portrait of Christ Jesus, and he is to paint according 
to that copy. The true Christian is to be such a husband as Christ 
was to his church. The love of a husband is <i>special</i>. The Lord Jesus cherishes for the church a peculiar affection, which 
is set upon her above the rest of mankind: “I pray for them, I pray not for the world.” The elect church is the favourite of heaven, the treasure of Christ, 
the crown of his head, the bracelet of his arm, the breastplate of 
his heart, the very centre and core of his love. A husband should 
love his wife with a <i>constant</i> love, for thus Jesus loves his church. He does not vary in his affection. 
He may change in his display of affection, but the affection itself 
is still the same. A husband should love his wife with an <i>enduring</i> love, for nothing “shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.” A true husband loves his wife with a <i>hearty</i> love, fervent and intense. It is not mere lip-service. Ah! beloved, 
what more could Christ have done in proof of his love than he has 
done? Jesus has a <i>delighted</i> <i>love</i> towards his spouse: He prizes her affection, and delights in her 
with sweet complacence. Believer, you wonder at Jesus’ love; you admire it—<i>are you imitating it</i>? In your domestic relationships is the rule and measure of your love—“<i>even as Christ loved the church</i>?”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0321am-p3">Few had fellowship with the sorrows of Gethsemane. The majority of 
the disciples were not sufficiently advanced in grace to be admitted 
to behold the mysteries of “the agony.” Occupied with the passover feast at their own houses, they represent 
the many who live upon the letter, but are mere babes as to the spirit 
of the gospel. To twelve, nay, to eleven only was the privilege given 
to enter Gethsemane and see “this great sight.” Out of the eleven, eight were left at a distance; they had fellowship, 
but not of that intimate sort to which men greatly beloved are admitted. 
Only three highly favoured ones could approach the veil of our Lord’s mysterious sorrow: within that veil even these must not intrude; 
a stone's-cast distance must be left between. He must tread the wine-press 
<i>alone</i>, and of the people there must be none with him. Peter and the two 
sons of Zebedee, represent the few eminent, experienced saints, who 
may be written down as “Fathers;” these having done business on great waters, can in some degree measure 
the huge Atlantic waves of their Redeemer’s passion. To some selected spirits it is given, for the good of others, 
and to strengthen them for future, special, and tremendous conflict, 
to enter the inner circle and hear the pleadings of the suffering 
High Priest; they have fellowship with him in his sufferings, and 
are made conformable unto his death. Yet even these cannot penetrate 
the secret places of the Saviour’s woe. “Thine unknown sufferings” is the remarkable expression of the Greek liturgy: there was an inner 
chamber in our Master’s grief, shut out from human knowledge and fellowship. There Jesus 
is “<i>left alone</i>.” Here Jesus was more than ever an “Unspeakable gift!” Is not Watts right when he sings—</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0321pm-p3">If inclined to boast of our abilities, the grandeur of nature may 
soon show us how puny we are. We cannot move the least of all the 
twinkling stars, or quench so much as one of the beams of the morning. 
We speak of power, but the heavens laugh us to scorn. When the Pleiades 
shine forth in spring with vernal joy we cannot restrain their influences, 
and when Orion reigns aloft, and the year is bound in winter’s fetters, we cannot relax the icy bands. The seasons revolve according 
to the divine appointment, neither can the whole race of men effect 
a change therein. Lord, what is man?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0321pm-p4">In the spiritual, as in the natural world, man’s power is limited on all hands. When the Holy Spirit sheds abroad 
his delights in the soul, none can disturb; all the cunning and malice 
of men are ineffectual to stay the genial quickening power of the 
Comforter. When he deigns to visit a church and revive it, the most 
inveterate enemies cannot resist the good work; they may ridicule 
it, but they can no more restrain it than they can push back the spring 
when the Pleiades rule the hour. God wills it, and so it must be. 
On the other hand, if the Lord in sovereignty, or in justice, bind 
up a man so that he is in soul bondage, who can give him liberty? 
He alone can remove the winter of spiritual death from an individual 
or a people. He looses the bands of Orion, and none but he. What a 
blessing it is that he can do it. O that he would perform the wonder 
tonight. Lord, end my winter, and let my spring begin. I cannot with 
all my longings raise my soul out of her death and dulness, but all 
things are possible with thee. I need celestial influences, the clear 
shinings of thy love, the beams of thy grace, the light of thy countenance; 
these are the Pleiades to me. I suffer much from sin and temptation; 
these are my wintry signs, my terrible Orion. Lord, work wonders in 
me, and for me. Amen.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0322am-p3">There are several instructive features in our Saviour’s prayer in his hour of trial. It was <i>lonely prayer</i>. He withdrew even from his three favoured disciples. Believer, be 
much in solitary prayer, especially in times of trial. Family prayer, 
social prayer, prayer in the Church, will not suffice, these are very 
precious, but the best beaten spice will smoke in your censer in your 
private devotions, where no ear hears but God's.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0322am-p4">It was <i>humble prayer</i>. Luke says he knelt, but another evangelist says he “fell on his face.” Where, then, must be <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0322am-p4.1">thy</span>  place, thou humble servant of the great Master? What dust and ashes 
should cover <i>thy</i> head! Humility gives us good foot-hold in prayer. There is no hope 
of prevalence with God unless we abase ourselves that he may exalt 
us in due time.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0322am-p5">It was <i>filial prayer</i>. “Abba, Father.” You will find it a stronghold in the day of trial to plead your adoption. 
You have no rights as a subject, you have forfeited them by your treason; 
but nothing can forfeit a child’s right to a father’s protection. Be not afraid to say, “My Father, hear my cry.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0322am-p6">Observe that it was <i>persevering prayer</i>. He prayed three times. Cease not until you prevail. Be as the importunate 
widow, whose continual coming earned what her first supplication could 
not win. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0322am-p7">Lastly, <i>it was the prayer of resignation</i>. “Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.” Yield, and God yields. Let it be as God wills, and God will determine 
for the best. Be thou content to leave thy prayer in his hands, who 
knows when to give, and how to give, and what to give, and what to 
withhold. So pleading, earnestly, importunately, yet with humility 
and resignation, thou shalt surely prevail.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0322pm-p3">O death! why dost thou touch the tree beneath whose spreading branches 
weariness hath rest? Why dost thou snatch away the excellent of the 
earth, in whom is all our delight? If thou must use thine axe, use 
it upon the trees which yield no fruit; thou mightest be thanked then. 
But why wilt thou fell the goodly cedars of Lebanon? O stay thine 
axe, and spare the righteous. But no, it must not be; death smites 
the goodliest of our friends; the most generous, the most prayerful, 
the most holy, the most devoted must die. And why? It is through Jesus’ prevailing prayer—“Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me 
where I am.” It is <i>that</i> which bears them on eagle’s wings to heaven. Every time a believer mounts from this earth to 
paradise, it is an answer to Christ’s prayer. A good old divine remarks, “Many times Jesus and his people pull against one another in prayer. 
You bend your knee in prayer and say ‘Father, I will that thy saints be with me where <i>I</i> am;’ Christ says, ‘Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me 
where <i>I</i> am.’” Thus the disciple is at cross-purposes with his Lord. The soul cannot 
be in both places: the beloved one cannot be with Christ and with 
you too. Now, which pleader shall win the day? If you had your choice; 
if the King should step from his throne, and say, “Here are two supplicants praying in opposition to one another, which 
shall be answered?” Oh! I am sure, though it were agony, you would start from your feet, 
and say, “Jesus, not my will, but thine be done.” You would give up your prayer for your loved one’s life, if you could realize the thoughts that Christ is praying in 
the opposite direction—“Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me 
where I am.” Lord, thou shalt have them. By faith we let them go.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0323am-p3">The mental pressure arising from our Lord’s struggle with temptation, so forced his frame to an unnatural excitement, 
that his pores sent forth great drops of blood which fell down to 
the ground. This proves <i>how tremendous must have been the weight</i> <i>of sin</i> when it was able to crush the Saviour so that he distilled great 
drops of blood! This demonstrates <i>the mighty</i> <i>power of his love</i>. It is a very pretty observation of old Isaac Ambrose that the gum 
which exudes from the tree without cutting is always the best. This 
precious camphire-tree yielded most sweet spices when it was wounded 
under the knotty whips, and when it was pierced by the nails on the 
cross; but see, it giveth forth its best spice when there is no whip, 
no nail, no wound. This sets forth the <i>voluntariness of Christ's</i> <i>sufferings</i>, since without a lance the blood flowed freely. No need to put on 
the leech, or apply the knife; it flows spontaneously. No need for 
the rulers to cry, “Spring up, O well;” of itself it flows in crimson torrents. If men suffer great pain 
of mind apparently the blood rushes to the heart. The cheeks are pale; 
a fainting fit comes on; the blood has gone inward as if to nourish 
the inner man while passing through its trial. But see our Saviour 
in his agony; he is so utterly oblivious of self, that instead of 
his agony driving his blood to the heart to nourish himself, it drives 
it outward to bedew the earth. The agony of Christ, inasmuch as it 
pours him out upon the ground, pictures the fulness of the offering 
which he made for men.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0323am-p4">Do we not perceive how intense must have been the wrestling through 
which he passed, and will we not hear its voice <i>to</i> <i>us? “Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against</i> <i>sin.”</i> Behold the great Apostle and High Priest of our profession, and sweat 
even to blood rather than yield to the great tempter of your souls.</p>

appearance of an angel unto him strengthening him removed that fear. 
He was heard in that he feared; he was no more alone, but heaven was

<p class="normal" id="d0324pm-p3">The Saviour was “a man of sorrows,” but every thoughtful mind has discovered the fact that down deep 
in his innermost soul he carried an inexhaustible treasury of refined 
and heavenly joy. Of all the human race, there was never a man who 
had a deeper, purer, or more abiding peace than our Lord Jesus Christ. 
“He was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows.” His vast benevolence must, from the very nature of things, have afforded 
him the deepest possible delight, for benevolence is joy. There were 
a few remarkable seasons when this joy manifested itself. “At that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth.” Christ had his songs, though it was night with him; though his face 
was marred, and his countenance had lost the lustre of earthly happiness, 
yet sometimes it was lit up with a matchless splendour of unparalleled 
satisfaction, as he thought upon the recompense of the reward, and 
in the midst of the congregation sang his praise unto God. In this, 
the Lord Jesus is a blessed picture of his church on earth. At this 
hour the church expects to walk in sympathy with her Lord along a 
thorny road; through much tribulation she is forcing her way to the 
crown. To bear the cross is her office, and to be scorned and counted 
an alien by her mother’s children is her lot; and yet the church has a deep well of joy, 
of which none can drink but her own children. There are stores of 
wine, and oil, and corn, hidden in the midst of our Jerusalem, upon 
which the saints of God are evermore sustained and nurtured; and sometimes, 
as in our Saviour’s case, we have our seasons of intense delight, for “There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of 
our God.” Exiles though we be, we rejoice in our King; yea, in him we exceedingly 
rejoice, while in his name we set up our banners.</p>

will, if possible, betray me as it did my Master, with a kiss. Whenever 
a man is about to stab religion, he usually professes very great reverence 
for it. Let me beware of the sleek-faced hypocrisy which is armour-bearer 
to heresy and infidelity. Knowing the deceivableness of unrighteousness, 
let me be wise as a serpent to detect and avoid the designs of the 
enemy. The young man, void of understanding, was led astray by the 
kiss of the strange woman: may my soul be so graciously instructed

a poor frail son of man, be betrayed with a kiss!</p>

Jesus; I am a member of his visible Church; I sit at the communion

If not, I am a base traitor. Do I live in the world as carelessly 
as others do, and yet make a profession of being a follower of Jesus? 
Then I must expose religion to ridicule, and lead men to speak evil 
of the holy name by which I am called. Surely if I act thus inconsistently 
I am a Judas, and it were better for me that I had never been born. 
Dare I hope that I am clear in this matter? Then, O Lord, keep me 
so. O Lord, make me sincere and true. Preserve me from every false 
way. Never let me betray my Saviour. I do love thee, Jesus, and though 
I often grieve thee, yet I would desire to abide faithful even unto 
death. O God, forbid that I should be a high-soaring professor, and 
then fall at last into the lake of fire, because I betrayed my Master 
with a kiss.</p>

of God, the Everlasting Father, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the 
Prince of Peace; but behold the lowliness of Jesus! He prefers to 
call himself the Son of man. Let us learn a lesson of humility from 
our Saviour; let us never court great titles nor proud degrees. There 
is here, however, a far sweeter thought. Jesus loved manhood so much, 
that he delighted to honour it; and since it is a high honour, and 
indeed, the greatest dignity of manhood, that Jesus is the Son of 
man, he is wont to display this name, that he may as it were hang 
royal stars upon the breast of manhood, and show forth the love of 
God to Abraham’s seed. <i>Son of man</i>—whenever he said that word, he shed a halo round the head of Adam’s children. Yet there is perhaps a more precious thought still. Jesus 
Christ called himself the Son of man to express his oneness and sympathy 
with his people. He thus reminds us that he is the one whom we may 
approach without fear. As a man, we may take to him all our griefs 
and troubles, for he knows them by experience; in that he himself 
hath suffered as the “Son of man,” he is able to succour and comfort us. All hail, thou blessed Jesus! 
inasmuch as thou art evermore using the sweet name which acknowledges

trial, towards the sheep of his hand! The ruling passion is strong 
in death. He resigns himself to the enemy, but he interposes a word 
of power to set his disciples free. As to himself, like a sheep before 
her shearers he is dumb and opened not his mouth, but for his disciples’ sake he speaks with almighty energy. Herein is love, constant, self-forgetting, 
faithful love. But is there not far more here than is to be found 
upon the surface? Have we not the very soul and spirit of the atonement 
in these words? The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, 
and pleads that they must therefore go free. The Surety is bound, 
and justice demands that those for whom he stands a substitute should 
go their way. In the midst of Egypt’s bondage, that voice rings as a word of power, “<i>Let these go</i> <i>their way</i>.” Out of slavery of sin and Satan the redeemed must come. In every 
cell of the dungeons of Despair, the sound is echoed, “<i>Let these go their way</i>,” and forth come Despondency and Much-afraid. Satan hears the well-known 
voice, and lifts his foot from the neck of the fallen; and Death hears 
it, and the grave opens her gates to let the dead arise. <i>Their</i> <i>way</i> is one of progress, holiness, triumph, glory, and none shall dare 
to stay them in it. No lion shall be on their way, neither shall any 
ravenous beast go up thereon. “The hind of the morning” has drawn the cruel hunters upon himself, and now the most timid 
roes and hinds of the field may graze at perfect peace among the lilies 
of his loves. The thunder-cloud has burst over the Cross of Calvary, 
and the pilgrims of Zion shall never be smitten by the bolts of vengeance. 
Come, my heart, rejoice in the immunity which thy Redeemer has secured 
thee, and bless his name all the day, and every day.</p>

thou be distant? Though it be a day of judgment, yet thou canst not

one instructive instance of the frailty of all believers if left to 
themselves; they are but sheep at the best, and they flee when the 
wolf cometh. They had all been warned of the danger, and had promised 
to die rather than leave their Master; and yet they were seized with 
sudden panic, and took to their heels. It may be, that I, at the opening 
of this day, have braced up my mind to bear a trial for the Lord’s sake, and I imagine myself to be certain to exhibit perfect fidelity; 
but let me be very jealous of myself, lest having the same evil heart 
of unbelief, I should depart from my Lord as the apostles did. It 
is one thing to promise, and quite another to perform. It would have 
been to their eternal honour to have stood at Jesus’ side right manfully; they fled from honour; may I be kept from imitating 
them! Where else could they have been so safe as near their Master, 
who could presently call for twelve legions of angels? They fled from 
their true safety. O God, let me not play the fool also. Divine grace 
can make the coward brave. The smoking flax can flame forth like fire

there will be crumbs to throw on the floor for the dogs, and the children

was to have the devil cast out of her daughter. It was a very great 
thing to her, but she had such a high esteem of Christ, that she said, 
“It is nothing to him, it is but a crumb for Christ to give.” This is the royal road to comfort. Great thoughts of your sin alone

<p class="normal" id="d0328am-p4">for this love of Christ is indeed measureless and fathomless; none 
can attain unto it. Before we can have any right idea of the love 
of Jesus, we must understand his previous glory in its height of majesty, 
and his incarnation upon the earth in all its depths of shame. But 
who can tell us the majesty of Christ? When he was enthroned in the 
highest heavens he was very God of very God; by him were the heavens 
made, and all the hosts thereof. His own almighty arm upheld the spheres; 
the praises of cherubim and seraphim perpetually surrounded him; the 
full chorus of the hallelujahs of the universe unceasingly flowed 
to the foot of his throne: he reigned supreme above all his creatures, 
God over all, blessed forever. Who can tell his height of glory then? 
And who, on the other hand, can tell how low he descended? To be a 
man was something, to be a man of sorrows was far more; to bleed, 
and die, and suffer, these were much for him who was the Son of God; 
but to suffer such unparalleled agony—to endure a death of shame and desertion by his Father, this is a 
depth of condescending love which the most inspired mind must utterly 
fail to fathom. Herein is love! and truly it is love that “passeth knowledge.” O let this love fill our hearts with adoring gratitude, and lead

<p class="normal" id="d0328pm-p3">The merits of our great Redeemer are as sweet savour to the Most High. 
Whether we speak of the active or passive righteousness of Christ, 
there is an equal fragrance. There was a sweet savour in his active 
life by which he honoured the law of God, and made every precept to 
glitter like a precious jewel in the pure setting of his own person. 
Such, too, was his passive obedience, when he endured with unmurmuring 
submission, hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness, and at length sweat 
great drops of blood in Gethsemane, gave his back to the smiters, 
and his cheeks to them that plucked out the hair, and was fastened 
to the cruel wood, that he might suffer the wrath of God in our behalf. 
These two things are sweet before the Most High; and for the sake 
of his doing and his dying, his substitutionary sufferings and his 
vicarious obedience, the Lord our God accepts us. What a preciousness 
must there be in him to overcome our want of preciousness! What a 
sweet savour to put away our ill savour! What a cleansing power in 
his blood to take away sin such as ours! and what glory in his righteousness 
to make such unacceptable creatures to be accepted in the Beloved! 
Mark, believer, how sure and unchanging must be our acceptance, since 
it is <i>in him</i>! Take care that you never doubt your acceptance in Jesus. You cannot 
be accepted without Christ; but, when you have received his merit, 
you cannot be unaccepted. Notwithstanding all your doubts, and fears, 
and sins, Jehovah’s gracious eye never looks upon you in anger; though he sees sin in 
you, in yourself, yet when he looks at you through Christ, he sees 
no sin. You are always accepted in Christ, are always blessed and 
dear to the Father’s heart. Therefore lift up a song, and as you see the smoking incense 
of the merit of the Saviour coming up, this evening, before the sapphire 
throne, let the incense of your praise go up also.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0329am-p3">We are told that the Captain of our salvation was made perfect through 
suffering, therefore we who are sinful, and who are far from being 
perfect, must not wonder if we are called to pass through suffering 
too. Shall the head be crowned with thorns, and shall the other members 
of the body be rocked upon the dainty lap of ease? Must Christ pass 
through seas of his own blood to win the crown, and are we to walk 
to heaven dryshod in silver slippers? No, our Master’s experience teaches us that suffering is necessary, and the true-born 
child of God must not, would not, escape it if he might. But there 
is one very comforting thought in the fact of Christ’s “being made perfect through suffering”—it is, that he can have complete sympathy with us. “He is not an high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of 
our infirmities.” In this sympathy of Christ we find a sustaining power. One of the 
early martyrs said, “I can bear it all, for Jesus suffered, and he suffers in me now; he 
sympathizes with me, and this makes me strong.” Believer, lay hold of this thought in all times of agony. Let the 
thought of Jesus strengthen you as you follow in his steps. Find a 
sweet support in his sympathy; and remember that, to suffer is an 
honourable thing—to suffer for Christ is glory. The apostles rejoiced that they were 
counted worthy to do this. Just so far as the Lord shall give us grace 
to suffer <i>for</i> Christ, to suffer <i>with</i> Christ, just so far does he honour us. The jewels of a Christian 
are his afflictions. The regalia of the kings whom God hath anointed 
are their troubles, their sorrows, and their griefs. Let us not, therefore, 
shun being honoured. Let us not turn aside from being exalted. Griefs 
exalt us, and troubles lift us up. “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0329pm-p3">Prayer sometimes tarrieth, like a petitioner at the gate, until the 
King cometh forth to fill her bosom with the blessings which she seeketh. 
The Lord, when he hath given great faith, has been known to try it 
by long delayings. He has suffered his servants’ voices to echo in their ears as from a brazen sky. They have knocked 
at the golden gate, but it has remained immovable, as though it were 
rusted upon its hinges. Like Jeremiah, they have cried, “Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not 
pass through.” Thus have true saints continued long in patient waiting without reply, 
not because their prayers were not vehement, nor because they were 
unaccepted, but because it so pleased him who is a Sovereign, and 
who gives according to his own pleasure. If it pleases him to bid 
our patience exercise itself, shall he not do as he wills with his 
own! Beggars must not be choosers either as to time, place, or form. 
But we must be careful not to take delays in prayer for denials: God’s long-dated bills will be punctually honoured; we must not suffer 
Satan to shake our confidence in the God of truth by pointing to our 
unanswered prayers. Unanswered petitions are not unheard. God keeps 
a file for our prayers—they are not blown away by the wind, they are treasured in the King’s archives. This is a registry in the court of heaven wherein every 
prayer is recorded. Tried believer, thy Lord hath a tear-bottle in 
which the costly drops of sacred grief are put away, and a book in 
which thy holy groanings are numbered. By and by, thy suit shall prevail. 
Canst thou not be content to wait a little? Will not thy Lord’s time be better than thy time? By and by he will comfortably appear, 
to thy soul’s joy, and make thee put away the sackcloth and ashes of long waiting, 
and put on the scarlet and fine linen of full fruition.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0330am-p3">Why did Jesus suffer himself to be enrolled amongst sinners? This 
wonderful condescension was justified by many powerful reasons. <i>In such a character he could the better become their</i> <i>advocate</i>. In some trials there is an identification of the counsellor with 
the client, nor can they be looked upon in the eye of the law as apart 
from one another. Now, when the sinner is brought to the bar, Jesus 
appears there himself. <i>He</i> stands to answer the accusation. He points to his side, his hands, 
his feet, and challenges Justice to bring anything against the sinners 
whom he represents; he pleads his blood, and pleads so triumphantly, 
being numbered with them and having a part with them, that the Judge 
proclaims, “Let them go their way; deliver them from going down into the pit, 
for he hath found a ransom.” Our Lord Jesus was numbered with the transgressors in order that 
they might <i>feel their hearts drawn</i> <i>towards him</i>. Who can be afraid of one who is written in the same list with us? 
Surely we may come boldly to him, and confess our guilt. He who is 
numbered with us cannot condemn us. Was he not put down in the transgressor’s list <i>that we might be</i> <i>written in the red roll of the saints</i>? He was holy, and written among the holy; we were guilty, and numbered 
among the guilty; he transfers his name from yonder list to this black 
indictment, and our names are taken from the indictment and written 
in the roll of acceptance, for there is a complete transfer made between 
Jesus and his people. All our estate of misery and sin Jesus has taken; 
and all that Jesus has comes to us. His righteousness, his blood, 
and everything that he hath he gives us as our dowry. Rejoice, believer, 
in your union to him who was numbered among the transgressors; and prove 
that you are truly saved by being manifestly numbered with those who 
are new creatures in him.</p>

an uplifted finger will be grievous to loving children, who fear to 
offend their tender father, and are only happy in his smile. Beloved, 
it was so once with you. A text of Scripture, a threatening, a touch 
of the rod of affliction, and you went to your Father’s feet, crying, “Show me wherefore thou contendest with me?” Is it so now? Are you content to follow Jesus afar off? Can you contemplate 
suspended communion with Christ without alarm? Can you bear to have 
your Beloved walking contrary to you, because you walk contrary to 
him? Have your sins separated between you and your God, and is your 
heart at rest? O let me affectionately warn you, for it is a grievous 
thing when we can live contentedly without the present enjoyment of 
the Saviour’s face. <i>Let us labour to feel</i> <i>what an evil thing this is</i>—little love to our own dying Saviour, little joy in our precious Jesus, 
little fellowship with the Beloved! Hold a true Lent in your souls, 
while you sorrow over your hardness of heart. Do not stop at sorrow! 
Remember where you first received salvation. <i>Go at once to the</i> <i>cross</i>. There, and there only, can you get your spirit quickened. No matter 
how hard, how insensible, how dead we may have become, let us go again 
in all the rags and poverty, and defilement of our natural condition. 
Let us clasp that cross, let us look into those languid eyes, let 
us bathe in that fountain filled with blood—this will bring back to us our first love; this will restore the simplicity 
of our faith, and the tenderness of our heart.</p>

his cross our solace. Those ghastly corpses might well have affrighted 
Rizpah, especially by night, but in our Lord, at whose cross-foot

Never was living beauty so enchanting as a dying Saviour. Jesus, we

In beginning a new month, let us seek the same desires after our Lord 
as those which glowed in the heart of the elect spouse. See how she 
leaps at once to <i>him</i>; there are no prefatory words; she does not even mention his name; 
she is in the heart of her theme at once, for she speaks of <i>him</i> who was the only him in the world to her. How bold is her love! It 
was much condescension which permitted the weeping penitent to anoint 
his feet with spikenard—it was rich love which allowed the gentle Mary to sit at his feet 
and learn of him—but here, love, strong, fervent love, aspires to higher tokens of 
regard, and closer signs of fellowship. Esther trembled in the presence 
of Ahasuerus, but the spouse in joyful liberty of perfect love knows 
no fear. If we have received the same free spirit, we also may ask 
the like. By kisses we suppose to be intended those varied manifestations 
of affection by which the believer is made to enjoy the love of Jesus. 
The kiss of <i>reconciliation</i> we enjoyed at our conversion, and it was sweet as honey dropping 
from the comb. The kiss of <i>acceptance</i> is still warm on our brow, as we know that he hath accepted our persons 
and our works through rich grace. The kiss of daily, present <i>communion</i> is that which we pant after to be repeated day after day, till it 
is changed into the kiss of <i>reception</i>, which removes the soul from earth, and the kiss of <i>consummation</i> which fills it with the joy of heaven. Faith is our walk, but fellowship 
sensibly felt is our rest. Faith is the road, but communion with Jesus 
is the well from which the pilgrim drinks. O lover of our souls, be 
not strange to us; let the lips of thy blessing meet the lips of our 
asking; let the lips of thy fulness touch the lips of our need, and 
straightway the kiss will be effected.</p>

at the gates of the flowery year. Reader, if you are yet unsaved, 
may your heart, in accord with the universal awakening of nature, 
be opened to receive the Lord. Every blossoming flower warns you that 
<i>it is time to seek the Lord</i>; be not out of tune with nature, but let your heart bud and bloom

in it. Young men and maidens, since you may perish ere you reach your 
prime, “<i>It is time to seek the Lord</i>.” Ye who feel the first signs of decay, quicken your pace: that hollow 
cough, that hectic flush, are warnings which you must not trifle with; 
with you <i>it is indeed time to seek the Lord</i>. Did I observe a little grey mingled with your once luxurious tresses? 
Years are stealing on apace, and death is drawing nearer by hasty 
marches, let each return of spring arouse you to set your house in 
order. Dear reader, if you are now advanced in life, let me entreat 
and implore you to delay no longer. There is a day of grace for you 
now—be thankful for that, but it is a limited season and grows shorter

<p class="normal" id="d0402am-p3">He had never been slow of speech when he could bless the sons of men, 
but he would not say a single word for himself. “Never man spake like this man,” and never man was silent like him. Was this singular silence <i>the index of his perfect 
self-sacrifice</i>? Did it show that he would not utter a word to stay the slaughter 
of his sacred person, which he had dedicated as an offering for us? 
Had he so entirely surrendered himself that he would not interfere 
in his own behalf, even in the minutest degree, but be bound and slain 
an unstruggling, uncomplaining victim? Was this silence <i>a type of the</i> <i>defencelessness of sin</i>? Nothing can be said in palliation or excuse of human guilt; and, 
therefore, he who bore its whole weight stood speechless before his 
judge. Is not patient silence <i>the best reply to a gainsaying world</i>? Calm endurance answers some questions infinitely more conclusively 
than the loftiest eloquence. The best apologists for Christianity 
in the early days were its martyrs. The anvil breaks a host of hammers 
by quietly bearing their blows. Did not the silent Lamb of God furnish 
us with <i>a grand example of wisdom</i>? Where every word was occasion for new blasphemy, it was the line 
of duty to afford no fuel for the flame of sin. The ambiguous and 
the false, the unworthy and mean, will ere long overthrow and confute 
themselves, and therefore the true can afford to be quiet, and finds 
silence to be its wisdom. Evidently our Lord, by his silence, furnished 
<i>a remarkable fulfilment of</i> <i>prophecy</i>. A long defence of himself would have been contrary to Isaiah’s prediction: “He is led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers 
is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.” By his quiet he conclusively proved himself to be the true Lamb of 
God. As such we salute him this morning. Be with us, Jesus, and in 
the silence of our heart, let us hear the voice of thy love.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0402pm-p3">Plead for the speedy fulfilment of this promise, all ye who love the 
Lord. It is easy work to pray when we are grounded and bottomed, as 
to our desires, upon God’s own promise. How can he that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable 
veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot 
degrade itself by neglect. God must bless his Son, his covenant binds 
him to it. That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that 
which God decrees to give him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom 
of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which 
draweth near, when the Crucified shall receive his coronation in the 
place where men rejected him. Courage, you that prayerfully work and 
toil for Christ with success of the very smallest kind, it shall not 
be so always; better times are before you. Your eyes cannot see the 
blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath 
of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming 
glory. Reader, let us ask, <i>do you</i> make this your constant prayer? Remember that the same Christ who 
tells us to say, “Give us this day our daily bread,” had first given us this petition, “Hallowed be thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done in earth 
as it is in heaven.” Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, 
your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry 
ladder, and get up to Christ himself, and then, as you draw nigh to 
the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, “Lord, extend the kingdom of thy dear Son.” Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of 
all your devotions. Mind that you prove the sincerity of your prayer 
by labouring to promote the Lord’s glory.</p>

the hall of Caiaphas, he had been hurried from Caiaphas to Pilate, 
from Pilate to Herod, and from Herod back again to Pilate; he had, 
therefore, but little strength left, and yet neither refreshment nor 
rest were permitted him. They were eager for his blood, and therefore 
led him out to die, loaded with the cross. O dolorous procession! 
Well may Salem’s daughters weep. My soul, do thou weep also.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0403am-p4">What learn we here as we see our blessed Lord led forth? Do we not 
perceive that truth which was set forth in shadow by <i>the scapegoat</i>? Did not the high-priest bring the scapegoat, and put both his hands 
upon its head, confessing the sins of the people, that thus those 
sins might be laid upon the goat, and cease from the people? Then 
the goat was led away by a fit man into the wilderness, and it carried 
away the sins of the people, so that if they were sought for they 
could not be found. Now we see Jesus brought before the priests and 
rulers, who pronounce him guilty; God himself imputes our sins <i>to him</i>, “the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;” “He was made sin for us;” and, as the substitute for our guilt, bearing our sin upon his shoulders, 
represented by the cross; we see the great Scapegoat led away by the 
appointed officers of justice. Beloved, can you feel assured that 
he carried <i>your</i> sin? As you look at the cross upon his shoulders, does it represent 
<i>your</i> sin? There is one way by which you can tell whether he carried your 
sin or not. Have you laid your hand upon his head, confessed your 
sin, and trusted in him? Then your sin lies not on you; it has all 
been transferred by blessed imputation to Christ, and he bears it 
on his shoulder as a load heavier than the cross.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0403pm-p3">Here a confession of sin <i>common</i> to all the elect people of God. They have all fallen, and therefore, 
in common chorus, they all say, from the first who entered heaven 
to the last who shall enter there, “All we like sheep have gone astray.” The confession, while thus unanimous, is also <i>special</i> and particular: “We have turned every one to his own way.” There is a peculiar sinfulness about every one of the individuals; 
all are sinful, but each one with some special aggravation not found 
in his fellow. It is the mark of genuine repentance that while it 
naturally associates itself with other penitents, it also takes up 
a position of loneliness. “We have turned every one to his own way,” is a confession that each man had sinned against light peculiar to 
himself, or sinned with an aggravation which he could not perceive 
in others. This confession is <i>unreserved</i>; there is not a word to detract from its force, nor a syllable by 
way of excuse. The confession is <i>a giving up</i> <i>of all pleas of self-righteousness</i>. It is the declaration of men who are consciously guilty—guilty with aggravations, guilty without excuse: they stand with their 
weapons of rebellion broken in pieces, and cry, “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his 
own way.” Yet we hear no dolorous wailings attending this confession of sin; 
for the next sentence makes it almost a song. “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.” It is the most grievous sentence of the three, but it overflows with 
comfort. Strange is it that where misery was concentrated mercy reigned; 
where sorrow reached her climax weary souls find rest. The Saviour 
bruised is the healing of bruised hearts. See how the lowliest penitence 
gives place to assured confidence through simply gazing at Christ 
on the cross!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0404pm-p3">It is exceedingly beneficial to our souls to mount above this present 
evil world to something nobler and better. The cares of this world 
and the deceitfulness of riches are apt to choke everything good within 
us, and we grow fretful, desponding, perhaps proud and carnal. It 
is well for us to cut down these thorns and briers, for heavenly seed 
sown among them is not likely to yield a harvest; and where shall 
we find a better sickle with which to cut them down than communion 
with God and the things of the kingdom? In the valleys of Switzerland, 
many of the inhabitants are deformed, and all wear a sickly appearance, 
for the atmosphere is charged with miasma, and is close and stagnant; 
but up yonder, on the mountain, you find a hardy race, who breathe 
the clear fresh air as it blows from the virgin snows of the Alpine 
summits. It would be well if the dwellers in the valley could frequently 
leave their abodes among the marshes and the fever mists, and inhale 
the bracing element upon the hills. It is to such an exploit of climbing 
that I invite you this evening. May the Spirit of God assist us to 
leave the mists of fear and the fevers of anxiety, and all the ills 
which gather in this valley of earth, and to ascend the mountains 
of anticipated joy and blessedness. May God the Holy Spirit cut the 
cords that keep us here below, and assist us to mount! We sit too 
often like chained eagles fastened to the rock, only that, unlike 
the eagle, we begin to love our chain, and would, perhaps, if it came 
really to the test, be loath to have it snapped. May God now grant 
us grace, if we cannot escape from the chain as to our flesh, yet 
to do so as to our spirits; and leaving the body, like a servant, 
at the foot of the hill, may our soul, like Abraham, attain the top 
of the mountain, there to indulge in communion with the Most High.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0405am-p3">We see in Simon’s carrying the cross a picture of the work of the Church throughout 
all generations; she is the cross-bearer after Jesus. Mark then, Christian, 
Jesus does not suffer so as to exclude your suffering. He bears a 
cross, not that you may escape it, but that you may endure it. Christ 
exempts you from sin, but not from sorrow. Remember that, and expect 
to suffer.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0405am-p4">But let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that in our case, 
as in Simon's, <i>it is not our cross, but Christ’s cross</i> <i>which we carry.</i> When you are molested for your piety; when your religion brings the 
trial of cruel mockings upon you, then remember it is not <i>your</i> cross, it is <i>Christ's</i> cross; and how delightful is it to carry the cross of our Lord Jesus!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0405am-p5"><i>You carry the cross after him</i>. You have blessed company; your path is marked with the footprints

and follow him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0405am-p6">Do not forget, also, <i>that you bear this cross in</i> <i>partnership</i>. It is the opinion of some that Simon only carried one end of the 
cross, and not the whole of it. That is very possible; Christ may 
have carried the heavier part, against the transverse beam, and Simon 
may have borne the lighter end. Certainly it is so with you; you do 
but carry the light end of the cross, Christ bore the heavier end.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0405am-p7">And remember, <i>though Simon had to bear the cross for a very</i> <i>little while, it gave him lasting honour</i>. Even so the cross <i>we</i> carry is only for a little while at most, and then we shall receive 
the crown, the glory. Surely we should love the cross, and, instead 
of shrinking from it, <i>count it very dear</i>, when it works out for us “a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0405pm-p3">Humiliation of soul always <i>brings a positive blessing with</i> <i>it</i>. If we empty our hearts of self, God will fill them with his love. 
He who desires close communion with Christ should remember the word 
of the Lord, “To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite 
spirit, and trembleth at my word.” Stoop if you would climb to heaven. Do we not say of Jesus, “He descended that he might ascend?” So must you. You must grow downwards, that you may grow upwards; 
for the sweetest fellowship with heaven is to be had by humble souls, 
and by them alone. God will deny no blessing to a thoroughly humbled 
spirit. “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,” with all its riches and treasures. The whole exchequer of God shall 
be made over by deed of gift to the soul which is humble enough to 
be able to receive it without growing proud because of it. God blesses 
us all up to the full measure and extremity of what it is safe for 
him to do. If you do not get a blessing, it is because it is not safe 
for you to have one. If our heavenly Father were to let your unhumbled 
spirit win a victory in his holy war, you would pilfer the crown for 
yourself, and meeting with a fresh enemy you would fall a victim; 
so that you are kept low for your own safety. When a man is sincerely 
humble, and never ventures to touch so much as a grain of the praise, 
there is scarcely any limit to what God will do for him. Humility 
makes us ready to be blessed by the God of all grace, and fits us 
to deal efficiently with our fellow men. True humility is a flower 
which will adorn any garden. This is a sauce with which you may season 
every dish of life, and you will find an improvement in every case. 
Whether it be prayer or praise, whether it be work or suffering, the 
genuine salt of humility cannot be used in excess.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0406am-p3">Jesus, bearing his cross, went forth to suffer without the gate. The 
Christian’s reason for leaving the camp of the world’s sin and religion is not because he loves to be singular, but because 
<i>Jesus did so</i>; and the disciple must follow his Master. Christ was “not of the world:” his life and his testimony were a constant protest against conformity 
with the world. Never was such overflowing affection for men as you 
find in him; but still he was separate from sinners. In like manner 
Christ’s people must “go forth unto him.” They must take their position “without the camp,” as witness-bearers for the truth. They must be prepared to tread 
the straight and narrow path. They must have bold, unflinching, lion-like 
hearts, loving Christ first, and his truth next, and Christ and his 
truth beyond all the world. Jesus would have his people “go forth without the camp” <i>for their own sanctification</i>. You cannot grow in grace to any high degree while you are conformed 
to the world. The life of separation may be a path of sorrow, but 
it is the highway of safety; and though the separated life may cost 
you many pangs, and make every day a battle, yet it is a happy life 
after all. No joy can excel that of the soldier of Christ: Jesus reveals 
himself so graciously, and gives such sweet refreshment, that the 
warrior feels more calm and peace in his daily strife than others 
in their hours of rest. The highway of holiness is the highway of 
communion. It is thus we shall hope <i>to win the crown</i> if we are enabled by divine grace faithfully to follow Christ “without the camp.” The crown of glory will follow the cross of separation. A moment’s shame will be well recompensed by eternal honour; a little while 
of witness-bearing will seem nothing when we are “forever with the Lord.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0406pm-p3">Our Lord Jesus, by his death, did not purchase a right to a part of 
us only, but to the entire man. He contemplated in his passion the 
sanctification of us wholly, spirit, soul, and body; that in this 
triple kingdom he himself might reign supreme without a rival. It 
is the business of the newborn nature which God has given to the regenerate 
to assert the rights of the Lord Jesus Christ. My soul, so far as 
thou art a child of God, thou must conquer all the rest of thyself 
which yet remains unblest; thou must subdue all thy powers and passions 
to the silver sceptre of Jesus’ gracious reign, and thou must never be satisfied till he who is King 
by purchase becomes also King by gracious coronation, and reigns in 
thee supreme. Seeing, then, that sin has no right to any part of us, 
we go about a good and lawful warfare when we seek, in the name of 
God, to drive it out. O my body, thou art a member of Christ: shall 
I tolerate thy subjection to the prince of darkness? O my soul, Christ 
has suffered for thy sins, and redeemed thee with his most precious 
blood: shall I suffer thy memory to become a storehouse of evil, or 
thy passions to be firebrands of iniquity? Shall I surrender my judgment 
to be perverted by error, or my will to be led in fetters of iniquity? 
No, my soul, thou art Christ's, and sin hath no right to thee.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0406pm-p4">Be courageous concerning this, O Christian! be not dispirited, as 
though your spiritual enemies could never be destroyed. You are able 
to overcome them—not in your own strength—the weakest of them would be too much for you in that; but you can 
and shall overcome them through the blood of the Lamb. Do not ask, 
“How shall I dispossess them, for they are greater and mightier than 
I?” but go to the strong for strength, wait humbly upon God, and the 
mighty God of Jacob will surely come to the rescue, and you shall 
sing of victory through his grace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p3">An instructive writer has made a mournful list of the honours which 
the blinded people of Israel awarded to their long expected King.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p4">1. They gave him <i>a procession of honour</i>, in which Roman legionaries, Jewish priests, men and women, took 
a part, he himself bearing his cross. This is the triumph which the 
world awards to him who comes to overthrow man’s direst foes. Derisive shouts are his only acclamations, and cruel 
taunts his only paeans of praise.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p5">2. They presented him with <i>the wine of honour</i>. Instead of a golden cup of generous wine they offered him the criminal’s stupefying death-draught, which he refused because he would preserve 
an uninjured taste wherewith to taste of death; and afterwards when 
he cried, “I thirst,” they gave him vinegar mixed with gall, thrust to his mouth upon a 
sponge. Oh! wretched, detestable inhospitality to the King’s Son.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p6">3. He was provided with <i>a guard of honour</i>, who showed their esteem of him by gambling over his garments, which 
they had seized as their booty. Such was the body-guard of the adored 
of heaven; a quaternion of brutal gamblers.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p7">4. <i>A throne of honour</i> was found for him upon the bloody tree; no easier place of rest would 
rebel men yield to their liege Lord. The cross was, in fact, the full 
expression of the world’s feeling towards him; “There,” they seemed to say, “thou Son of God, this is the manner in which God himself should be 
treated, could we reach him.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407am-p8">5. <i>The title of honour</i> was nominally “King of the Jews,” but that the blinded nation distinctly repudiated, and really called 
him “King of thieves,” by preferring Barabbas, and by placing Jesus in the place of highest 
shame between two thieves. His glory was thus in all things turned 
into shame by the sons of men, but it shall yet gladden the eyes of 
saints and angels, world without end.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0407pm-p3">In this <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0407pm-p3.1">solemn confession</span>, it is pleasing to observe that David plainly names his sin. He does 
not call it manslaughter, nor speak of it as an imprudence by which 
an unfortunate accident occurred to a worthy man, but he calls it 
by its true name, bloodguiltiness. He did not actually kill the husband 
of Bathsheba; but still it was planned in David’s heart that Uriah should be slain, and he was before the Lord his 
murderer. Learn in confession to be honest with God. Do not give fair 
names to foul sins; call them what you will, they will smell no sweeter. 
What God sees them to be, that do you labour to feel them to be; and 
with all openness of heart acknowledge their real character. Observe, 
that David was evidently oppressed with the heinousness of his sin. 
It is easy to use words, but it is difficult to feel their meaning. 
The fifty-first Psalm is the photograph of a contrite spirit. Let 
us seek after the like brokenness of heart; for however excellent 
our words may be, if our heart is not conscious of the hell-deservingness 
of sin, we cannot expect to find forgiveness.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407pm-p4">Our text has in it <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0407pm-p4.1">an earnest prayer</span>—it is addressed to the God of <i>salvation</i>. It is his prerogative to forgive; it is his very name and office 
to save those who seek his face. Better still, the text calls him 
the God of <i>my</i> salvation. Yes, blessed be his name, while I am yet going to him 
through Jesus’ blood, I can rejoice in the God of <i>my</i> salvation.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0407pm-p5">The psalmist ends with <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0407pm-p5.1">a commendable vow</span>: if God will deliver him he will <i>sing</i>—nay, more, he will “<i>sing aloud</i>.” Who can sing in any other style of such a mercy as this! But note 
the subject of the song—“<span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0407pm-p5.2">Thy righteousness</span>.” We must sing of the finished work of a precious Saviour; and he who 
knows most of forgiving love will sing the loudest.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0408am-p3">Among other interpretations of this suggestive question, the following 
is full of teaching: “If the innocent substitute for sinners, suffer thus, what will be 
done when the sinner himself—the dry tree—shall fall into the hands of an angry God?” When God saw Jesus in the sinner’s place, he did not spare him; and when he finds the unregenerate 
without Christ, he will not spare them. O sinner, Jesus was led away 
by his enemies: so shall you be dragged away by fiends to the place 
appointed for you. Jesus was deserted of God; and if he, who was only 
imputedly a sinner, was deserted, how much more shall you be? “<i>Eloi, Eloi, lama</i> <i>sabachthani</i>?” what an awful shriek! But what shall be your cry when you shall say, 
“O God! O God! why hast thou forsaken me?” and the answer shall come back, “Because ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my 
reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your 
fear cometh.” If God spared not his own Son, how much less will he spare you! What 
whips of burning wire will be yours when conscience shall smite you 
with all its terrors. Ye richest, ye merriest, ye most self-righteous 
sinners—who would stand in your place when God shall say, “Awake, O sword, against the man that rejected me; smite him, and let 
him feel the smart forever”? Jesus was spit upon: sinner, what shame will be yours! We cannot 
sum up in one word all the mass of sorrows which met upon the head 
of Jesus who died for us; therefore it is impossible for us to tell 
you what streams, what oceans of grief must roll over <i>your</i> spirit if you die as you now are. You may die so, you may die now. 
By the agonies of Christ, by his wounds and by his blood, do not bring 
upon yourselves the wrath to come! Trust in the Son of God, and you 
shall never die.</p>

has no power to suspend the music of a Christian’s heart, but rather makes that music become more sweet, more clear, 
more heavenly, till the last kind act which death can do is to let 
the earthly strain melt into the heavenly chorus, the temporal joy 
into the eternal bliss! Let us have confidence, then, in the blessed 
Spirit’s power to comfort us. Dear reader, are you looking forward to poverty? 
Fear not; the divine Spirit can give you, in your want, a greater 
plenty than the rich have in their abundance. You know not what joys

bodily powers? Do you expect to suffer long nights of languishing

You little know how every pang that shoots through your body may be 
a refining fire to consume your dross—a beam of glory to light up the secret parts of your soul. Are the 
eyes growing dim? Jesus will be your light. Do the ears fail you? 
Jesus’ name will be your soul’s best music, and his person your dear delight. Socrates used to say, 
“Philosophers can be happy without music;” and Christians can be happier than philosophers when all outward 
causes of rejoicing are withdrawn. In thee, my God, my heart shall

my heart shall be exceeding glad, though all things should fail me

<p class="normal" id="d0409am-p3">Amid the rabble rout which hounded the Redeemer to his doom, there 
were some gracious souls whose bitter anguish sought vent in wailing 
and lamentations—fit music to accompany that march of woe. When my soul can, in imagination, 
see the Saviour bearing his cross to Calvary, she joins the godly 
women and weeps with them; for, indeed, there is true cause for grief—cause lying deeper than those mourning women thought. They bewailed 
innocence maltreated, goodness persecuted, love bleeding, meekness 
about to die; but my heart has a deeper and more bitter cause to mourn. 
My sins were the scourges which lacerated those blessed shoulders, 
and crowned with thorn those bleeding brows: my sins cried “Crucify him! crucify him!” and laid the cross upon his gracious shoulders. His being led forth 
to die is sorrow enough for one eternity: but my having been his murderer, 
is more, infinitely more, grief than one poor fountain of tears can 
express.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0409am-p4">Why those women loved and wept it were not hard to guess: but they 
could not have had greater reasons for love and grief than my heart 
has. Nain’s widow saw her son restored—but I myself have been raised to newness of life. Peter’s wife’s mother was cured of the fever—but I of the greater plague of sin. Out of Magdalene seven devils 
were cast—but a whole legion out of me. Mary and Martha were favoured with visits—but he dwells with me. His mother bare his body—but he is formed in me the hope of glory. In nothing behind the holy 
women in debt, let me not be behind them in gratitude or sorrow.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0409pm-p3">The words are capable of being translated, “thy <i>goodness</i> hath made me great.” David gratefully ascribed all his greatness not to his own goodness, 
but the goodness of God. “Thy <i>providence</i>,” is another reading; and providence is nothing more than goodness 
in action. Goodness is the bud of which providence is the flower, 
or goodness is the seed of which providence is the harvest. Some render 
it, “thy <i>help</i>,” which is but another word for providence; providence being the firm 
ally of the saints, aiding them in the service of their Lord. Or again, 
“thy <i>humility</i> hath made me great.” “Thy <i>condescension</i>” may, perhaps, serve as a comprehensive reading, combining the ideas 
mentioned, including that of <i>humility</i>. It is God’s making himself little which is the cause of our being made great. 
We are so little, that if God should manifest his greatness without 
condescension, we should be trampled under his feet; but God, who 
must stoop to view the skies, and bow to see what angels do, turns 
his eye yet lower, and looks to the lowly and contrite, and makes 
them great. There are yet other readings, as for instance, the Septuagint, 
which reads, “thy discipline”—thy fatherly correction—“hath made me great;” while the Chaldee paraphrase reads, “thy word hath increased me.” Still the idea is the same. David ascribes all his own greatness 
to the condescending goodness of his Father in heaven. May this sentiment 
be echoed in our hearts this evening while we cast our crowns at Jesus’ feet, and cry, “thy gentleness hath made me great.” How marvellous has been our experience of God’s gentleness! How gentle have been his corrections! How gentle his 
forbearance! How gentle his teachings! How gentle his drawings! Meditate 
upon this theme, O believer. Let gratitude be awakened; let humility 
be deepened; let love be quickened ere thou fallest asleep tonight.</p>

gusheth with waters pure as crystal, each drop capable of alleviating 
the woes of mankind. You who have had your seasons of conflict, will 
confess that it was not at Olivet that you ever found comfort, not 
on the hill of Sinai, nor on Tabor; but Gethsemane, Gabbatha, and 
Golgotha have been a means of comfort to you. The bitter herbs of 
Gethsemane have often taken away the bitters of your life; the scourge 
of Gabbatha has often scourged away your cares, and the groans of 
Calvary have put all other groans to flight. Thus Calvary yields us 
comfort rare and rich. We never should have known Christ’s love in all its heights and depths if he had not died; nor could 
we guess the Father’s deep affection if he had not given his Son to die. The common mercies 
we enjoy all sing of love, just as the sea-shell, when we put it to 
our ears, whispers of the deep sea whence it came; but if we desire 
to hear the ocean itself, we must not look at every-day blessings, 
but at the transactions of the crucifixion. He who would know love, 
let him retire to Calvary and see the Man of sorrows die.</p>

had brought the crew of the vessel into a sad case; one man alone 
among them remained perfectly calm, and by his word the rest were 
reassured. Paul was the only man who had heart enough to say, “Sirs, be of good cheer.” There were veteran Roman legionaries on board, and brave old mariners, 
and yet their poor Jewish prisoner had more spirit than they all. 
He had a secret Friend who kept his courage up. The Lord Jesus despatched 
a heavenly messenger to whisper words of consolation in the ear of 
his faithful servant; therefore he wore a shining countenance, and 
spake like a man at ease.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0410pm-p4">If we fear the Lord, we may look for timely interpositions when our

by darkness. Seraphs think it no humiliation to visit the poorest

frequent in our nights of tempest and tossing. Friends may drop from 
us when we are under pressure, but our intercourse with the inhabitants 
of the angelic world shall be more abundant; and in the strength of 
love-words, brought to us from the throne by the way of Jacob’s ladder, we shall be strong to do exploits. Dear reader, is this 
an hour of distress with you? then ask for peculiar help. Jesus is

<p class="normal" id="d0411am-p3">Did earth or heaven ever behold a sadder spectacle of woe! In soul 
and body, our Lord felt himself to be weak as water poured upon the 
ground. The placing of the cross in its socket had shaken him with 
great violence, had strained all the ligaments, pained every nerve, 
and more or less dislocated all his bones. Burdened with his own weight, 
the august sufferer felt the strain increasing every moment of those 
six long hours. His sense of faintness and general weakness were overpowering; 
while to his own consciousness he became nothing but a mass of misery 
and swooning sickness. When Daniel saw the great vision, he thus describes 
his sensations, “There remained no strength in me, for my vigour was turned into corruption, 
and I retained no strength:” how much more faint must have been our greater Prophet when he saw 
the dread vision of the wrath of God, and felt it in his own soul! To us, sensations such as our Lord endured would 
have been insupportable, and kind unconsciousness would have come 
to our rescue; but in his case, he was wounded, and <i>felt</i> the sword; he drained the cup and <i>tasted</i> every drop.</p>

In his natural body every member suffered, and so must it be in the 
spiritual; but as out of all his griefs and woes his body came forth 
uninjured to glory and power, even so shall his mystical body come 
through the furnace with not so much as the smell of fire upon it.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0411pm-p3">It is well for us when prayers about our sorrows are linked with pleas 
concerning our sins—when, being under God’s hand, we are not wholly taken up with our pain, but remember our 
offences against God. It is well, also, to take both sorrow and sin 
to the same place. It was to God that David carried his sorrow: it 
was to God that David confessed his sin. Observe, then, <i>we</i> <i>must take our sorrows to God</i>. Even your little sorrows you may roll upon God, for he counteth 
the hairs of your head; and your great sorrows you may commit to him, 
for he holdeth the ocean in the hollow of his hand. Go to him, whatever 
your present trouble may be, and you shall find him able and willing 
to relieve you. <i>But we must take our sins to God too</i>. We must carry them to the cross, that the blood may fall upon them, 
to purge away their guilt, and to destroy their defiling power.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0411pm-p4">The special lesson of the text is this:—that <i>we are to go</i> <i>to the Lord with sorrows and with sins in the right spirit</i>. Note that all David asks concerning his sorrow is, “<i>Look</i> <i>upon</i> mine affliction and my pain;” but the next petition is vastly more express, definite, decided, 
plain—“<i>Forgive</i> all my sins.” Many sufferers would have put it, “Remove my affliction and my pain, and look at my sins.” But David does not say so; he cries, “Lord, as for my affliction and my pain, I will not dictate to thy 
wisdom. Lord, look at them, I will leave them to thee, I should be 
glad to have my pain removed, but do as thou wilt; but as for my sins, 
Lord, I know what I want with them; I must have them forgiven; I cannot 
endure to lie under their curse for a moment.” A Christian counts sorrow lighter in the scale than sin; he can bear 
that his troubles should continue, but he cannot support the burden 
of his transgressions.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0412am-p3">Our blessed Lord experienced a terrible sinking and melting of soul. 
“The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit 
who can bear?” Deep depression of spirit is the most grievous of all trials; all 
besides is as nothing. Well might the suffering Saviour cry to his 
God, “Be not far from me,” for above all other seasons a man needs his God when his heart is 
melted within him because of heaviness. Believer, come near the cross 
this morning, and humbly adore the King of glory as having once been 
brought far lower, in mental distress and inward anguish, than any 
one among us; and mark his fitness to become a faithful High Priest, 
who can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. Especially let 
those of us whose sadness springs directly from the withdrawal of 
a present sense of our Father’s love, enter into near and intimate communion with Jesus. Let us 
not give way to despair, since through this dark room the Master has 
passed before us. Our souls may sometimes long and faint, and thirst 
even to anguish, to behold the light of the Lord’s countenance: at such times let us stay ourselves with the sweet 
fact of the sympathy of our great High Priest. Our drops of sorrow 
may well be forgotten in the ocean of his griefs; but how high ought 
our love to rise! Come in, O strong and deep love of Jesus, like the 
sea at the flood in spring tides, cover all my powers, drown all my 
sins, wash out all my cares, lift up my earth-bound soul, and float 
it right up to my Lord’s feet, and there let me lie, a poor broken shell, washed up by his 
love, having no virtue or value; and only venturing to whisper to 
him that if he will put his ear to me, he will hear within my heart 
faint echoes of the vast waves of his own love which have brought 
me where it is my delight to lie, even at his feet forever.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0412pm-p3">Mention of the king’s garden by Nehemiah brings to mind the <i>paradise</i> which the King of kings prepared for Adam. Sin has utterly ruined 
that fair abode of all delights, and driven forth the children of 
men to till the ground, which yields thorns and briers unto them. 
My soul, remember the fall, for it was <i>thy</i> fall. Weep much because the Lord of love was so shamefully ill-treated 
by the head of the human race, of which thou art a member, as undeserving 
as any. Behold how dragons and demons dwell on this fair earth, which 
once was a garden of delights.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0412pm-p4">See yonder another King’s garden, which the King waters with his bloody sweat—<i>Gethsemane</i>, whose bitter herbs are sweeter far to renewed souls than even Eden’s luscious fruits. There the mischief of the serpent in the first 
garden was undone: there the curse was lifted from earth, and borne 
by the woman’s promised seed. My soul, bethink thee much of the agony and the passion; 
resort to the garden of the olive-press, and view thy great Redeemer 
rescuing thee from thy lost estate. This is the garden of gardens 
indeed, wherein the soul may see the guilt of sin and the power of 
love, two sights which surpass all others.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0412pm-p5">Is there no other King’s garden? Yes, <i>my heart</i>, thou art, or shouldst be such. How do the flowers flourish? Do any 
choice fruits appear? Does the King walk within, and rest in the bowers 
of my spirit? Let me see that the plants are trimmed and watered, 
and the mischievous foxes hunted out. Come, Lord, and let the heavenly 
wind blow at thy coming, that the spices of thy garden may flow abroad. 
Nor must I forget the King’s garden of <i>the church</i>. O Lord, send prosperity unto it. Rebuild her walls, nourish her 
plants, ripen her fruits, and from the huge wilderness, reclaim the 
barren waste, and make thereof “a King’s garden.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0413am-p3">Myrrh may well be chosen as the type of Jesus on account of <i>its preciousness, its perfume, its pleasantness,</i> <i>its healing, preserving, disinfecting qualities, and its</i> <i>connection with sacrifice</i>. But why is he compared to “a <i>bundle</i> of myrrh”? First, for <i>plenty</i>. He is not a drop of it, he is a casket full. He is not a sprig or 
flower of it, but a whole bundle. There is enough in Christ for all 
my necessities; let me not be slow to avail myself of him. Our well-beloved 
is compared to a “bundle” again, for <i>variety</i>: for there is in Christ not only the one thing needful, but in “him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;” everything needful is in him. Take Jesus in his different characters, 
and you will see a marvellous variety—Prophet, Priest, King, Husband, Friend, Shepherd. Consider him in 
his life, death, resurrection, ascension, second advent; view him 
in his virtue, gentleness, courage, self-denial, love, faithfulness, 
truth, righteousness—everywhere he is a bundle of preciousness. He is a “bundle of myrrh” for <i>preservation</i>—not loose myrrh to be dropped on the floor or trodden on, but myrrh 
tied up, myrrh to be stored in a casket. We must value him as our 
best treasure; we must prize his words and his ordinances; and we 
must keep our thoughts of him and knowledge of him as under lock and 
key, lest the devil should steal anything from us. Moreover, Jesus 
is a “bundle of myrrh” <i>for speciality</i>; the emblem suggests the idea of distinguishing, discriminating grace. 
From before the foundation of the world, he was set apart for his 
people; and he gives forth his perfume only to those who understand 
how to enter into communion with him, to have close dealings with 
him. Oh! blessed people whom the Lord hath admitted into his secrets, 
and for whom he sets himself apart. Oh! choice and happy who are thus 
made to say, “A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0413pm-p3">Our Lord’s being made “sin for us” is set forth here by the very significant transfer of sin to the 
bullock, which was made by the elders of the people. The laying of 
the hand was not a mere touch of contact, for in some other places 
of Scripture the original word has the meaning of leaning heavily, 
as in the expression, “thy wrath lieth hard upon me” (<scripRef passage="Ps 88:7" id="d0413pm-p3.1" parsed="|Ps|88|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.88.7">Psalm 88:7</scripRef>). Surely this is the very essence and nature of faith, which doth 
not only bring us into contact with the great Substitute, but teaches 
us to lean upon him with all the burden of our guilt. Jehovah made 
to meet upon the head of the Substitute all the offences of his covenant 
people, but each one of the chosen is brought personally to ratify 
this solemn covenant act, when by grace he is enabled by faith to 
lay his hand upon the head of the “Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world.” Believer, do you remember that rapturous day when you first realized 
pardon through Jesus the sin-bearer? Can you not make glad confession, 
and join with the writer in saying, “My soul recalls her day of deliverance with delight. Laden with guilt 
and full of fears, I saw my Saviour as my Substitute, and I laid my 
hand upon him; oh! how timidly at first, but courage grew and confidence 
was confirmed until I leaned my soul entirely upon him; and now it 
is my unceasing joy to know that my sins are no longer imputed to 
me, but laid on him, and like the debts of the wounded traveller, 
Jesus, like the good Samaritan, has said of all my future sinfulness, 
‘Set that to my account.’” Blessed discovery! Eternal solace of a grateful heart!</p>

full meaning of these words. Some of us think at times that <i>we</i> could cry, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” There are seasons when the brightness of our Father’s smile is eclipsed by clouds and darkness; but let us remember that 
God never does really forsake us. It is only a seeming forsaking with 
us, but in Christ’s case it was a real forsaking. We grieve at a little withdrawal of 
our Father’s love; but the real turning away of God’s face from his Son, who shall calculate how deep the agony which 
it caused him?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0415am-p4">In our case, our cry is often dictated by unbelief: in his case, it 
was the utterance of a dreadful fact, for God had really turned away 
from him for a season. O thou poor, distressed soul, who once lived 
in the sunshine of God’s face, but art now in darkness, remember that he has not really forsaken 
thee. God in the clouds is as much our God as when he shines forth 
in all the lustre of his grace; but since even the <i>thought</i> that he has forsaken us gives us agony, what must the woe of the 
Saviour have been when he exclaimed, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0415pm-p3"><i>God’s people need lifting up</i>. They are very heavy by nature. They have no wings, or, if they have, 
they are like the dove of old which lay among the pots; and they need 
divine grace to make them mount on wings covered with silver, and 
with feathers of yellow gold. By nature sparks fly upward, but the 
sinful souls of men fall downward. O Lord, “lift them up forever!” David himself said, “Unto thee, O God, do I lift up my soul,” and he here feels the necessity that other men’s souls should be lifted up as well as his own. When you ask this 
blessing for yourself, forget not to seek it for others also. There 
are three ways in which God’s people require to be lifted up. <i>They require to be elevated in character</i>. Lift them up, O Lord; do not suffer thy people to be like the world’s people! The world lieth in the wicked one; lift them out of it! 
The world’s people are looking after silver and gold, seeking their own pleasures, 
and the gratification of their lusts; but, Lord, lift thy people up 
above all this; keep them from being “muck-rakers,” as John Bunyan calls the man who was always scraping after gold! 
Set thou their hearts upon their risen Lord and the heavenly heritage! 
Moreover, <i>believers need to be</i> <i>prospered in conflict</i>. In the battle, if they seem to fall, O Lord, be pleased to give 
them the victory. If the foot of the foe be upon their necks for a 
moment, help them to grasp the sword of the Spirit, and eventually 
to win the battle. Lord, lift up thy children’s spirits in the day of conflict; let them not sit in the dust, mourning 
forever. Suffer not the adversary to vex them sore, and make them 
fret; but if they have been, like Hannah, persecuted, let them sing 
of the mercy of a delivering God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0415pm-p4">We may also ask our Lord to <i>lift them up at the last</i>! Lift them up by taking them home, lift their bodies from the tomb, 
and raise their souls to thine eternal kingdom in glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0416am-p3">Standing at the foot of the cross, we see hands, and feet, and side, 
all distilling crimson streams of precious blood. It is “precious” because of its <i>redeeming</i> and <i>atoning</i> <i>efficacy</i>. By it the sins of Christ’s people are atoned for; they are redeemed from under the law; they 
are reconciled to God, made one with him. Christ’s blood is also “precious” in its <i>cleansing power</i>; it “cleanseth from all sin.” “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” Through Jesus’ blood there is not a spot left upon any believer, no wrinkle nor 
any such thing remains. O precious blood, which makes us clean, removing 
the stains of abundant iniquity, and permitting us to stand accepted 
in the Beloved, notwithstanding the many ways in which we have rebelled 
against our God. The blood of Christ is likewise “precious” in its <i>preserving</i> <i>power</i>. We are safe from the destroying angel under the sprinkled blood. 
Remember it is <i>God’s seeing</i> the blood which is the true reason for our being spared. Here is 
comfort for us when the eye of faith is dim, for God’s eye is still the same. The blood of Christ is “precious” also in its <i>sanctifying</i> <i>influence</i>. The same blood which justifies by taking away sin, does in its after-action, 
quicken the new nature and lead it onward to subdue sin and to follow 
out the commands of God. There is no motive for holiness so great 
as that which streams from the veins of Jesus. And “precious,” unspeakably precious, is this blood, because it has an <i>overcoming power</i>. It is written, “They overcame through the blood of the Lamb.” How could they do otherwise? He who fights with the precious blood 
of Jesus, fights with a weapon which cannot know defeat. The blood 
of Jesus! sin dies at its presence, death ceases to be death: heaven’s gates are opened. The blood of Jesus! we shall march on, conquering 
and to conquer, so long as we can trust its power!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0416pm-p3">So mighty was the prayer of Moses, that all depended upon it. The 
petitions of Moses discomfited the enemy more than the fighting of 
Joshua. Yet both were needed. So, in the soul’s conflict, force and fervour, decision and devotion, valour and vehemence, 
must join their forces, and all will be well. You must wrestle with 
your sin, but the major part of the wrestling must be done alone in 
private with God. Prayer, like Moses’, holds up the token of the covenant before the Lord. The rod was 
the emblem of God’s working with Moses, the symbol of God’s government in Israel. Learn, O pleading saint, to hold up the promise 
and the oath of God before him. The Lord cannot deny his own declarations. 
Hold up the rod of promise, and have what you will.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0416pm-p4">Moses grew weary, and then his friends assisted him. When at any time 
your prayer flags, let faith support one hand, and let holy hope uplift 
the other, and prayer seating itself upon the stone of Israel, the 
rock of our salvation, will persevere and prevail. Beware of faintness 
in devotion; if Moses felt it, who can escape? It is far easier to 
fight with sin in public, than to pray against it in private. It is 
remarked that Joshua never grew weary in the fighting, but Moses did 
grow weary in the praying; the more spiritual an exercise, the more 
difficult it is for flesh and blood to maintain it. Let us cry, then, 
for special strength, and may the Spirit of God, who helpeth our infirmities, 
as he allowed help to Moses, enable us like him to continue with our 
hands steady “<i>until the going down of the</i> <i>sun</i>;” till the evening of life is over; till we shall come to the rising 
of a better sun in the land where prayer is swallowed up in praise.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0417am-p3">Reader, have <i>you</i> come to the blood of sprinkling? The question is not whether you 
have come to a knowledge of doctrine, or an observance of ceremonies, 
or to a certain form of experience, but <i>have you come to the blood of Jesus</i>? The blood of Jesus is the life of all vital godliness. If you have 
truly come to Jesus, we know how you came—the Holy Spirit sweetly brought you there. You came to the blood of 
sprinkling with no merits of your own. Guilty, lost, and helpless, 
you came to take that blood, and that blood alone, as your everlasting 
hope. You came to the cross of Christ, with a trembling and an aching 
heart; and oh! what a precious sound it was to you to hear the voice 
of the blood of Jesus! The dropping of his blood is as the music of 
heaven to the penitent sons of earth. We are full of sin, but the 
Saviour bids us lift our eyes to him, and as we gaze upon his streaming wounds, each drop of blood, as it falls, cries, “It is finished; I have made an end of sin; I have brought in everlasting 
righteousness.” Oh! sweet language of the precious blood of Jesus! If you have come 
to that blood once, you will come to it constantly. Your life will 
be “Looking unto Jesus.” Your whole conduct will be epitomized in this—“To whom coming.” Not to whom I <i>have</i> come, but to whom I am <i>always coming</i>. If thou hast ever come to the blood of sprinkling, thou wilt feel 
thy need of coming to it every day. He who does not desire to wash 
in it <i>every day</i>, has never washed in it at all. The believer ever feels it to be 
his joy and privilege that there is still a fountain opened. Past 
experiences are doubtful food for Christians; a present coming to 
Christ alone can give us joy and comfort. This morning let us sprinkle 
our door-post fresh with blood, and then feast upon the Lamb, assured 
that the destroying angel must pass us by.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0417pm-p3">Evermore the worldling’s cry is, “Who will show us any good?” He seeks satisfaction in earthly comforts, enjoyments, and riches. 
But the quickened sinner knows of only one good. “O that I knew where I might find <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0417pm-p3.1">Him</span> !” When he is truly awakened to feel his guilt, if you could pour the 
gold of India at his feet, he would say, “Take it away: I want to find <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0417pm-p3.2">Him</span>.” It is a blessed thing for a man, when he has brought his desires 
into a focus, so that they all centre in one object. When he has fifty 
different desires, his heart resembles a mire of stagnant water, spread 
out into a marsh, breeding miasma and pestilence; but when all his 
desires are brought into one channel, his heart becomes like a river 
of pure water, running swiftly to fertilize the fields. Happy is he 
who hath one desire, if that one desire be set on Christ, though it 
may not yet have been realized. If Jesus be a soul’s desire, it is a blessed sign of divine work within. Such a man will 
never be content with mere ordinances. He will say, “I want Christ; I <i>must</i> have him—mere ordinances are of no use to me; I want <i>himself</i>; do not offer me these; you offer me the empty pitcher, while I am 
dying of thirst; give me water, or I die. Jesus is my soul’s desire. I would see Jesus!”</p>

desire, and is that after Christ? Then thou art not far from the kingdom 
of heaven. Hast thou but one wish in thy heart, and that one wish 
that thou mayst be washed from all thy sins in Jesus’ blood? Canst thou really say, “I would give all I have to be a Christian; I would give up everything 
I have and hope for, if I might but feel that I have an interest in 
Christ?” Then, despite all thy fears, be of good cheer, the Lord loveth thee, 
and thou shalt come out into daylight soon, and rejoice in the liberty 
wherewith Christ makes men free.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0418am-p3">Rahab depended for her preservation upon the promise of the spies, 
whom she looked upon as the representatives of the God of Israel. 
Her faith was simple and firm, but it was very obedient. To tie the 
scarlet line in the window was a very trivial act in itself, but she 
dared not run the risk of omitting it. Come, my soul, is there not 
here a lesson for thee? Hast thou been attentive to all thy Lord’s will, even though some of his commands should seem non-essential? 
Hast thou observed in his own way the two ordinances of believers’ baptism and the Lord’s Supper? These neglected, argue much unloving disobedience in thy 
heart. Be henceforth in all things blameless, even to the tying of 
a thread, if that be matter of command.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0418am-p4">This act of Rahab sets forth a yet more solemn lesson. Have I implicitly 
trusted in the precious blood of Jesus? Have I tied the scarlet cord, 
as with a Gordian knot in my window, so that my trust can never be 
removed? Or can I look out towards the Dead Sea of my sins, or the 
Jerusalem of my hopes, without seeing the blood, and seeing all things 
in connection with its blessed power? The passer-by can see a cord 
of so conspicuous a colour, if it hangs from the window: it will be 
well for me if my life makes the efficacy of the atonement conspicuous 
to all onlookers. What is there to be ashamed of? Let men or devils 
gaze if they will, the blood is my boast and my song. My soul, there 
is One who will see that scarlet line, even when from weakness of 
faith thou canst not see it thyself; Jehovah, the Avenger, will see 
it and pass over thee. Jericho’s walls fell flat: Rahab’s house was on the wall, and yet it stood unmoved; my nature is built 
into the wall of humanity, and yet when destruction smites the race, 
I shall be secure. My soul, tie the scarlet thread in the window afresh, 
and rest in peace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0418pm-p3">When Jacob was on the other side of the brook Jabbok, and Esau was 
coming with armed men, he earnestly sought God’s protection, and as a master reason he pleaded, “And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good.” Oh, the force of that plea! He was holding God to his word—“Thou saidst.” The attribute of God’s faithfulness is a splendid horn of the altar to lay hold upon; but 
the promise, which has in it the attribute and something more, is 
a yet mightier holdfast—“Thou saidst, I will surely do thee good.” And has <i>he</i> said, and shall he not do it? “Let God be true, and every man a liar.” Shall not <i>he</i> be true? Shall <i>he</i> not keep his word? Shall not every word that cometh out of his lips 
stand fast and be fulfilled? Solomon, at the opening of the temple, 
used this same mighty plea. He pleaded with God to remember the word 
which he had spoken to his father David, and to bless that place. 
When a man gives a promissory note, his honour is engaged; he signs 
his hand, and he must discharge it when the due time comes, or else 
he loses credit. It shall never be said that God dishonours his bills. 
The credit of the Most High never was impeached, and never shall be. 
He is punctual to the moment: he never is before his time, but he 
never is behind it. Search God’s word through, and compare it with the experience of God’s people, and you shall find the two tally from the first to the last. 
Many a hoary patriarch has said with Joshua, “Not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your 
God spake concerning you; all are come to pass.” If you have a divine promise, you need not plead it with an “if,” you may urge it with certainty. The Lord meant to fulfil the promise, 
or he would not have given it. God does not give his words merely 
to quiet us, and to keep us hopeful for awhile with the intention 
of putting us off at last; but when he speaks, it is because he means 
to do as he has said.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0419am-p3">No mean miracle was wrought in the rending of so strong and thick 
a veil; but it was not intended merely as a display of power—many lessons were herein taught us. <i>The old law of</i> <i>ordinances was put away</i>, and like a worn-out vesture, rent and laid aside. When Jesus died, 
the sacrifices were all finished, because all fulfilled in him, and 
therefore the place of their presentation was marked with an evident 
token of decay. That rent also <i>revealed all the hidden things of the old</i> <i>dispensation</i>: the mercy-seat could now be seen, and the glory of God gleamed forth 
above it. By the death of our Lord Jesus we have a clear revelation 
of God, for he was “not as Moses, who put a veil over his face.” Life and immortality are now brought to light, and things which have 
been hidden since the foundation of the world are manifest in him. 
<i>The annual</i> <i>ceremony of atonement was thus abolished. The atoning blood</i> which was once every year sprinkled within the veil, was now offered 
once for all by the great High Priest, and therefore the place of 
the symbolical rite was broken up. No blood of bullocks or of lambs 
is needed now, for Jesus has entered within the veil with his own 
blood. Hence <i>access to God is now permitted</i>, and is the privilege of every believer in Christ Jesus. There is 
no small space laid open through which we may peer at the mercy-seat, 
but the rent reaches from the top to the bottom. We may come with 
boldness to the throne of the heavenly grace. Shall we err if we say 
that the opening of the Holy of Holies in this marvellous manner by 
our Lord’s expiring cry was <i>the type</i> <i>of the opening of the gates of paradise</i> to all the saints by virtue of the Passion? Our bleeding Lord hath 
the key of heaven; he openeth and no man shutteth; let us enter in 
with him into the heavenly places, and sit with him there till our 
common enemies shall be made his footstool.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0420am-p3">O child of God, death hath lost its sting, because the devil’s power over it is destroyed. Then cease to fear dying. Ask grace 
from God the Holy Ghost, that by an intimate knowledge and a firm 
belief of thy Redeemer’s death, thou mayst be strengthened for that dread hour. Living near 
the cross of Calvary thou mayst think of death with pleasure, and 
welcome it when it comes with intense delight. It is sweet to die 
in the Lord: it is a covenant-blessing to sleep in Jesus. Death is 
no longer banishment, it is a return from exile, a going home to the 
many mansions where the loved ones already dwell. The distance between 
glorified spirits in heaven and militant saints on earth seems great; 
but it is not so. We are not far from home—a moment will bring us there. The sail is spread; the soul is launched 
upon the deep. How long will be its voyage? How many wearying winds 
must beat upon the sail ere it shall be reefed in the port of peace? 
How long shall that soul be tossed upon the waves before it comes 
to that sea which knows no storm? Listen to the answer, “Absent from the body, present with the Lord.” Yon ship has just departed, but it is already at its haven. It did 
but spread its sail and it was there. Like that ship of old, upon 
the Lake of Galilee, a storm had tossed it, but Jesus said, “Peace, be still,” and <i>immediately</i> it came to land. Think not that a long period intervenes between 
the instant of death and the eternity of glory. When the eyes close 
on earth they open in heaven. The horses of fire are not an instant 
on the road. Then, O child of God, what is there for thee to fear 
in death, seeing that through the death of thy Lord its curse and 
sting are destroyed? and now it is but a Jacob’s ladder whose foot is in the dark grave, but its top reaches to glory 
everlasting.</p>

their ranks, and let no man’s heart fail him. It is true that just now in England the battle is 
turned against us, and unless the Lord Jesus shall lift his sword, 
we know not what may become of the church of God in this land; but 
let us be of good courage, and play the man. There never was a day 
when Protestantism seemed to tremble more in the scales than now that 
a fierce effort is making to restore the Romish antichrist to his 
ancient seat. We greatly want a bold voice and a strong hand to preach 
and publish the old gospel for which martyrs bled and confessors died. 
The Saviour is, by his Spirit, still on earth; let this cheer us. 
He is ever in the midst of the fight, and therefore the battle is 
not doubtful. And as the conflict rages, what a sweet satisfaction 
it is to know that the Lord Jesus, in his office as our great Intercessor, 
is prevalently pleading for his people! O anxious gazer, look not 
so much at the battle below, for there thou shalt be enshrouded in 
smoke, and amazed with garments rolled in blood; but lift thine eyes 
yonder where the Saviour lives and pleads, for while he intercedes, 
the cause of God is safe. Let us fight as if it all depended upon

truth and righteousness, for the kingdom and crown jewels of your 
Master. Onward! “for the battle is not yours but God's.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0421am-p3">The marrow of Job’s comfort lies in that little word “My”—“My Redeemer,” and in the fact that the Redeemer lives. Oh! to get hold of a living 
Christ. We must get a property in him before we can enjoy him. What 
is gold in the mine to me? Men are beggars in Peru, and beg their 
bread in California. It is gold in my purse which will satisfy my 
necessities, by purchasing the bread I need. So a Redeemer who does 
not redeem <i>me</i>, an avenger who will never stand up for <i>my</i> blood, of what avail were such? Rest not content until by faith you 
can say “Yes, I cast myself upon my living Lord; and he is mine.” It may be you hold him with a feeble hand; you half think it presumption 
to say, “He lives as <i>my</i> Redeemer;” yet, remember if you have but faith as a grain of mustard seed, that 
little faith <i>entitles</i> you to say it. But there is also another word here, expressive of 
Job’s strong confidence, “<i>I know</i>.” To say, “I hope so, I trust so” is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who 
hardly ever get much further. But to reach the essence of consolation 
you must say, “I know.” Ifs, buts, and perhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort. 
Doubts are dreary things in times of sorrow. Like wasps they sting 
the soul! If I have any suspicion that Christ is not mine, then there 
is vinegar mingled with the gall of death; but if I know that Jesus 
lives for me, then darkness is not dark: even the night is light about 
me. Surely if Job, in those ages before the coming and advent of Christ, 
could say, “I know,” <i>we</i> should not speak less positively. God forbid that our positiveness 
should be presumption. Let us see that our evidences are right, lest 
we build upon an ungrounded hope; and then let us not be satisfied 
with the mere foundation, for it is from the upper rooms that we get 
the widest prospect. A living Redeemer, truly mine, is joy unspeakable.</p>

for them, they had liberty; when he sat down at his Father’s right hand, they had favour, and honour, and dignity. The raising 
and elevation of Christ is the elevation, the acceptance, and enshrinement, 
the glorifying of all his people, for he is their head and representative. 
This sitting at the right hand of God, then, is to be viewed as the 
acceptance of the person of the Surety, the reception of the Representative, 
and therefore, the acceptance of <i>our</i> souls. O saint, see in this thy sure freedom from condemnation. “Who is he that condemneth?” Who shall condemn the men who are in Jesus at the right hand of God?</p>

can smite thee? Rest thou secure. If Jesus is thine all-prevailing 
King, and hath trodden thine enemies beneath his feet; if sin, death,

<p class="normal" id="d0422am-p3">Jesus, our Lord, once crucified, dead and buried, now sits upon the 
throne of glory. The highest place that heaven affords is his by undisputed 
right. It is sweet to remember that the exaltation of Christ in heaven 
is a <i>representative</i> <i>exaltation</i>. He is exalted at the Father’s right hand, and though as Jehovah he had eminent glories, in which 
finite creatures cannot share, yet as the Mediator, the honours which 
Jesus wears in heaven are the heritage of all the saints. It is delightful 
to reflect how close is Christ’s union with his people. We are actually one with him; we are members 
of his body; and his exaltation is our exaltation. He will give us 
to sit upon his throne, even as he has overcome, and is set down with 
his Father on his throne; he has a crown, and he gives us crowns too; 
he has a throne, but he is not content with having a throne to himself, 
on his right hand there must be his queen, arrayed in “gold of Ophir.” He cannot be glorified without his bride. Look up, believer, to Jesus 
now; let the eye of your faith behold him with many crowns upon his 
head; and remember that you will one day be like him, when you shall 
see him as he is; you shall not be so great as he is, you shall not 
be so divine, but still you shall, in a measure, share the same honours, 
and enjoy the same happiness and the same dignity which he possesses. 
Be content to live unknown for a little while, and to walk your weary 
way through the fields of poverty, or up the hills of affliction; 
for by-and-by you shall reign with Christ, for he has “made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever and 
ever.” Oh!, wonderful thought for the children of God! We have Christ for 
our glorious representative in heaven’s courts <i>now</i>, and soon he will come and receive us to himself, to be with him 
there, to behold his glory, and to share his joy.</p>

or fancied appearances, or the shriek of sudden sickness or death. 
We live in the world of death and sorrow, we may therefore look for 
ills as well in the night-watches as beneath the glare of the broiling 
sun. Nor should this alarm us, for be the terror what it may, the 
promise is that the believer shall not be afraid. Why should he? Let 
us put it more closely, why should <i>we</i>? God our Father is here, and will be here all through the lonely 
hours; he is an almighty Watcher, a sleepless Guardian, a faithful 
Friend. Nothing can happen without his direction, for even hell itself 
is under his control. Darkness is not dark to him. He has promised 
to be a wall of fire around his people—and who can break through such a barrier? Worldlings may well be afraid, 
for they have an angry God above them, a guilty conscience within 
them, and a yawning hell beneath them; but we who rest in Jesus are 
saved from all these through rich mercy. If we give way to foolish 
fear we shall dishonour our profession, and lead others to doubt the 
reality of godliness. We ought to be afraid of being afraid, lest 
we should vex the Holy Spirit by foolish distrust. Down, then, ye 
dismal forebodings and groundless apprehensions, God has not forgotten 
to be gracious, nor shut up his tender mercies; it may be night in 
the soul, but there need be no terror, for the God of love changes 
not. Children of light may walk in darkness, but they are not therefore 
cast away, nay, they are now enabled to prove their adoption by trusting 
in their heavenly Father as hypocrites cannot do.</p>

for power to fight our sins. Paul thus rebukes us, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey 
the truth? This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit 
by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? are ye so foolish? 
having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?” Take your sins to Christ’s cross, for the old man can only be crucified there: we are crucified 
<i>with</i> <i>him</i>. The only weapon to fight sin with is the spear which pierced the 
side of Jesus. To give an illustration—you want to overcome an angry temper; how do you go to work? It is 
very possible you have never tried the right way of going to Jesus 
with it. How did I get salvation? I came to Jesus just as I was, and 
I trusted him to save me. I must kill my angry temper in the same 
way. It is the only way in which I can ever kill it. I must go to 
the cross with it, and say to Jesus, “Lord, I trust thee to deliver me from it.” This is the only way to give it a death-blow. Are you covetous? Do you feel 
the world entangle you? You may struggle against this evil so long 
as you please, but if it be your besetting sin, you will never be 
delivered from it in any way but by the blood of Jesus. Take it to 
Christ. Tell him, “Lord, I have trusted thee, and thy name is Jesus, for thou dost save 
thy people from their sins: Lord, this is one of my sins; save me 
from it!” Ordinances are nothing without Christ as a means of mortification. 
Your prayers, and your repentances, and your tears—the whole of them put together—are worth nothing apart from him. “None but Jesus can do helpless sinners good;” or helpless saints either. You must be conquerors through him who 
hath loved you, if conquerors at all. Our laurels must grow among 
his olives in Gethsemane.</p>

the lily of matchless purity, and as the rose crimsoned with his own 
gore. Christ is lovely upon Olivet and Tabor, and by the sea, but 
oh! there never was such a matchless Christ as he that did hang upon 
the cross. There we beheld all his beauties in perfection, all his 
attributes developed, all his love drawn out, all his character expressed. 
Beloved, the wounds of Jesus are far more fair in our eyes than all 
the splendour and pomp of kings. The thorny crown is more than an 
imperial diadem. It is true that he bears not now the sceptre of reed, 
but there was a glory in it that never flashed from sceptre of gold. 
Jesus wears the appearance of a slain Lamb as his court dress in which 
he wooed our souls, and redeemed them by his complete atonement. Nor 
are these only the ornaments of Christ: they are the <i>trophies</i> of his love and of his victory. He has divided the spoil with the 
strong. He has redeemed for himself a great multitude whom no man

and with benefit, renew our covenant with God. After <i>recovery from sickness</i> when, like Hezekiah, we have had a new term of years added to our 
life, we may fitly do it. After any <i>deliverance from trouble</i>, when our joys bud forth anew, let us again visit the foot of the 
cross, and renew our consecration. Especially, let us do this after 
any <i>sin which</i> <i>has grieved the Holy Spirit</i>, or brought dishonour upon the cause of God; let us then look to 
that blood which can make us whiter than snow, and again offer ourselves 
unto the Lord. We should not only let our troubles confirm our dedication 
to God, but <i>our prosperity</i> should do the same. If we ever meet with occasions which deserve 
to be called “crowning mercies” then, surely, if he hath crowned us, we ought also to crown our God; 
let us bring forth anew all the jewels of the divine regalia which 
have been stored in the jewel-closet of our heart, and let our God 
sit upon the throne of our love, arrayed in royal apparel. If we would 
learn to profit by our prosperity, we should not need so much adversity. 
If we would gather from a kiss all the good it might confer upon us, 
we should not so often smart under the rod. Have we lately received 
some blessing which we little expected? Has the Lord put our feet 
in a large room? Can we sing of mercies multiplied? Then this is the 
day to put our hand upon the horns of the altar, and say, “Bind me here, my God; bind me here with cords, even forever.” Inasmuch as we need the fulfilment of new promises from God, let 
us offer renewed prayers that our old vows may not be dishonoured. 
Let us this morning make with him a sure covenant, because of the 
pains of Jesus which for the last month we have been considering with 
gratitude.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0424pm-p3">Sweet is the season of spring: the long and dreary winter helps us 
to appreciate its genial warmth, and its promise of summer enhances 
its present delights. After periods of depression of spirit, it is 
delightful to behold again the light of the Sun of Righteousness; 
then our slumbering graces rise from their lethargy, like the crocus 
and the daffodil from their beds of earth; then is our heart made 
merry with delicious notes of gratitude, far more melodious than the 
warbling of birds—and the comforting assurance of peace, infinitely more delightful 
than the turtle’s note, is heard within the soul. Now is the time for the soul to 
seek communion with her Beloved; now must she rise from her native 
sordidness, and come away from her old associations. If we do not 
hoist the sail when the breeze is favourable, we shall be blameworthy: 
times of refreshing ought not to pass over us unimproved. When Jesus 
himself visits us in tenderness, and entreats us to arise, can we 
be so base as to refuse his request? He has himself risen that he 
may draw us after him: he now by his Holy Spirit has revived us, that 
we may, in newness of life, ascend into the heavenlies, and hold communion 
with himself. Let our wintry state suffice us for coldness and indifference; 
when the Lord creates a spring within, let our sap flow with vigour, 
and our branch blossom with high resolve. O Lord, if it be not spring 
time in my chilly heart, I pray thee make it so, for I am heartily 
weary of living at a distance from thee. Oh! the long and dreary winter, 
when wilt thou bring it to an end? Come, Holy Spirit, and renew my 
soul! quicken thou me! restore me, and have mercy on me! This very 
night I would earnestly implore the Lord to take pity upon his servant, 
and send me a happy revival of spiritual life!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0425am-p3">Lo, I hear the voice of my Beloved! He speaks to <i>me</i>! Fair weather is smiling upon the face of the earth, and he would 
not have me spiritually asleep while nature is all around me awaking 
from her winter’s rest. He bids me “Rise up,” and well he may; for I have long enough been lying among the pots 
of worldliness. He is risen, I am risen in him, why then should I 
cleave unto the dust? From lower loves, desires, pursuits, and aspirations, 
I would rise towards him. He calls me by the sweet title of “My love,” and counts me fair; this is a good argument for my rising. If he 
has thus exalted me, and thinks me thus comely, how can I linger in 
the tents of Kedar and find congenial associates among the sons of 
men? He bids me “Come away.” Further and further from everything selfish, grovelling, worldly, 
sinful, he calls me; yea, from the outwardly religious world which 
knows him not, and has no sympathy with the mystery of the higher 
life, he calls me. “Come away” has no harsh sound in it to my ear, for what is there to hold me 
in this wilderness of vanity and sin? O my Lord, would that I could 
come away, but I am taken among the thorns, and cannot escape from 
them as I would. I would, if it were possible, have neither eyes, 
nor ears, nor heart for sin. Thou callest me to thyself by saying 
“Come away,” and this is a melodious call indeed. To come to thee is to come home 
from exile, to come to land out of the raging storm, to come to rest 
after long labour, to come to the goal of my desires and the summit 
of my wishes. But Lord, how can a stone rise, how can a lump of clay 
come away from the horrible pit? O raise me, draw me. Thy grace can 
do it. Send forth thy Holy Spirit to kindle sacred flames of love 
in my heart, and I will continue to rise until I leave life and time 
behind me, and indeed come away.</p>

near to Jesus; you must get a clear sight of him in his preciousness

the Holy One, by which he knows all things. Christ is the great master-key

will not open and yield up all its wealth to the soul that lives near 
to Jesus. Are you saying, “O that he would dwell in my bosom”? “Would that he would make my heart his dwelling-place forever”? Open the door, beloved, and he will come into your souls. He has 
long been knocking, and all with this object, that he may sup with 
you, and you with him. <i>He sups with you</i> because you find the house or the heart, and <i>you with him</i> because he brings the provision. He could not sup with you if it 
were not in your heart, you finding the house; nor could you sup with 
him, for you have a bare cupboard, if he did not bring provision with 
him. Fling wide, then, the portals of your soul. He will come with 
that love which you long to feel; he will come with that joy into 
which you cannot work your poor depressed spirit; he will bring the 
peace which now you have not; he will come with his flagons of wine 
and sweet apples of love, and cheer you till you have no other sickness 
but that of “love o'erpowering, love divine.” Only open the door to him, drive out his enemies, give him the keys 
of your heart, and he will dwell there forever. Oh, wondrous love,

<p class="normal" id="d0426am-p3">It seems then, that Christians may forget Christ! There could be no 
need for this loving exhortation, if there were not a fearful supposition 
that our memories might prove treacherous. Nor is this a bare supposition: 
it is, alas! too well confirmed in our experience, not as a possibility, 
but as a lamentable fact. It appears almost impossible that those 
who have been redeemed by the blood of the dying Lamb, and loved with 
an everlasting love by the eternal Son of God, should forget that 
gracious Saviour; but, if startling to the ear, it is, alas! too apparent 
to the eye to allow us to deny the crime. Forget him who never forgot 
us! Forget him who poured his blood forth for our sins! Forget him 
who loved us even to the death! Can it be possible? Yes, it is not 
only possible, but conscience confesses that it is too sadly a fault 
with all of us, that we suffer him to be as a wayfaring man tarrying 
but for a night. He whom we should make the abiding tenant of our 
memories is but a visitor therein. The cross where one would think 
that memory would linger, and unmindfulness would be an unknown intruder, 
is desecrated by the feet of forgetfulness. Does not your conscience 
say that this is true? Do you not find yourselves forgetful of Jesus? 
Some creature steals away your heart, and you are unmindful of him 
upon whom your affection ought to be set. Some earthly business engrosses 
your attention when you should fix your eye steadily upon the cross. 
It is the incessant turmoil of the world, the constant attraction 
of earthly things which takes away the soul from Christ. While memory 
too well preserves a poisonous weed, it suffereth the rose of Sharon 
to wither. Let us charge ourselves to bind a heavenly forget-me-not 
about our hearts for Jesus our Beloved, and, whatever else we let 
slip, let us hold fast to him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0426pm-p3">“We die daily,” said the apostle. This was the life of the early Christians; they 
went everywhere with their lives in their hands. We are not in this 
day called to pass through the same fearful persecutions: if we were, 
the Lord would give us grace to bear the test; but the tests of Christian 
life, at the present moment, though outwardly not so terrible, are 
yet more likely to overcome us than even those of the fiery age. We 
have to bear the sneer of the world—that is little; its blandishments, its soft words, its oily speeches, 
its fawning, its hypocrisy, are far worse. Our danger is lest we grow 
rich and become proud, lest we give ourselves up to the fashions of 
this present evil world, and lose our faith. Or if wealth be not the 
trial, worldly care is quite as mischievous. If we cannot be torn 
in pieces by the roaring lion, if we may be hugged to death by the 
bear, the devil little cares which it is, so long as he destroys our 
love to Christ, and our confidence in him. I fear me that the Christian 
church is far more likely to lose her integrity in these soft and 
silken days than in those rougher times. We must be awake now, for 
we traverse the enchanted ground, and are most likely to fall asleep 
to our own undoing, unless our faith in Jesus be a reality, and our 
love to Jesus a vehement flame. Many in these days of easy profession 
are likely to prove tares, and not wheat; hypocrites with fair masks 
on their faces, but not the true-born children of the living God. 
Christian, do not think that these are times in which you can dispense 
with watchfulness or with holy ardour; you need these things more 
than ever, and may God the eternal Spirit display his omnipotence 
in you, that you may be able to say, in all these softer things, as 
well as in the rougher, “We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0427am-p3">It is strange how little use we make of the spiritual blessings which 
God gives us, but it is stranger still how little use we make of God 
himself. Though he is “our own God,” we apply ourselves but little to him, and ask but little of him. 
How seldom do we ask counsel at the hands of the Lord! How often do 
we go about our business, without seeking his guidance! In our troubles 
how constantly do we strive to bear our burdens ourselves, instead 
of casting them upon the Lord, that he may sustain us! This is not 
because we may not, for the Lord seems to say, “I am thine, soul, come and make use of me as thou wilt; thou mayst 
freely come to my store, and the oftener the more welcome.” It is our own fault if we make not free with the riches of our God. 
Then, since thou hast such a friend, and he invites thee, draw from 
him daily. Never want whilst thou hast a God to go to; never fear 
or faint whilst thou hast God to help thee; go to thy treasure and 
take whatever thou needest—there is all that thou canst want. Learn the divine skill of making 
God all things to thee. He can supply thee with all, or, better still, 
he can be to thee instead of all. Let me urge thee, then, to make 
use of thy God. Make use of him <i>in prayer</i>. Go to him often, because he is <i>thy</i> God. O, wilt thou fail to use so great a privilege? Fly to him, tell 
him all thy wants. Use him constantly <i>by faith</i> at all times. If some dark providence has beclouded thee, use thy 
God as a “sun;” if some strong enemy has beset thee, find in Jehovah a “shield,” for he is a sun and shield to his people. If thou hast lost thy way 
in the mazes of life, use him as a “guide,” for he will direct thee. Whatever thou art, and wherever thou art, 
remember God is just <i>what</i> thou wantest, and just <i>where</i> thou wantest, and that he can do <i>all</i> thou wantest.</p>

and ask him to fulfil his own word. Are you seeking after Christ, 
and thirsting for closer communion with him? This promise shines like 
a star upon you—“Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they 
shall be filled.” Take that promise to the throne continually; do not plead anything 
else, but go to God over and over again with this—“Lord, thou hast said it, do as thou hast said.” Are you distressed because of sin, and burdened with the heavy load 
of your iniquities? Listen to these words—“I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions, and will no 
more remember thy sins.” You have no merit of your own to plead why he should pardon you, 
but plead his written engagements and he will perform them. Are you 
afraid lest you should not be able to hold on to the end, lest, after 
having thought yourself a child of God, you should prove a castaway? 
If that is your state, take this word of grace to the throne and plead 
it: “The mountains may depart, and the hills may be removed, but the covenant 
of my love shall not depart from thee.” If you have lost the sweet sense of the Saviour’s presence, and are seeking him with a sorrowful heart, remember the 
promises: “Return unto me, and I will return unto you;” “For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will 
I gather thee.” Banquet your faith upon God’s own word, and whatever your fears or wants, repair to the Bank of 
Faith with your Father’s note of hand, saying, “Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me

of spirit. Woe is me, I am one of the impudent house of Israel. The 
second charge is <i>hardheartedness</i>, and I must not venture to plead innocent here. Once I had nothing 
but a heart of stone, and although through grace I now have a new 
and fleshy heart, much of my former obduracy remains. I am not affected 
by the death of Jesus as I ought to be; neither am I moved by the 
ruin of my fellow men, the wickedness of the times, the chastisement 
of my heavenly Father, and my own failures, as I should be. O that 
my heart would melt at the recital of my Saviour’s sufferings and death. Would to God I were rid of this nether millstone 
within me, this hateful body of death. Blessed be the name of the 
Lord, the disease is not incurable, the Saviour’s precious blood is the universal solvent, and me, even me, it will 
effectually soften, till my heart melts as wax before the fire.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0429am-p3">The path of the Christian is not always bright with sunshine; he has 
his seasons of darkness and of storm. True, it is written in God’s Word, “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;” and it is a great truth, that religion is calculated to give a man 
happiness below as well as bliss above; but experience tells us that 
if the course of the just be “As the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day,” yet sometimes <i>that</i> light is eclipsed. At certain periods clouds cover the believer’s sun, and he walks in darkness and sees no light. There are many 
who have rejoiced in the presence of God for a season; they have basked 
in the sunshine in the earlier stages of their Christian career; they 
have walked along the “green pastures” by the side of the “still waters,” but suddenly they find the glorious sky is clouded; instead of the 
Land of Goshen they have to tread the sandy desert; in the place of 
sweet waters, they find troubled streams, bitter to their taste, and 
they say, “Surely, if I were a child of God, this would not happen.” Oh! say not so, thou who art walking in darkness. The best of God’s saints must drink the wormwood; the dearest of his children must 
bear the cross. No Christian has enjoyed perpetual prosperity; no 
believer can always keep his harp from the willows. Perhaps the Lord 
allotted you at first a smooth and unclouded path, because you were 
weak and timid. He tempered the wind to the shorn lamb, but now that 
you are stronger in the spiritual life, you must enter upon the riper 
and rougher experience of God’s full-grown children. We need winds and tempests to exercise our 
faith, to tear off the rotten bough of self-dependence, and to root 
us more firmly in Christ. The day of evil reveals to us the value 
of our glorious hope.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0429pm-p3">How comprehensive is the love of Jesus! There is no part of his people’s interests which he does not consider, and there is nothing which 
concerns their welfare which is not important to him. Not merely does 
he think of you, believer, as an immortal being, but as a mortal being 
too. Do not deny it or doubt it: “The very hairs of your head are all numbered.” “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth 
in his way.” It were a sad thing for us if this mantle of love did not cover all 
our concerns, for what mischief might be wrought to us in that part 
of our business which did not come under our gracious Lord’s inspection! Believer, rest assured that the heart of Jesus cares 
about your meaner affairs. The breadth of his tender love is such 
that you may resort to him in all matters; for in all your afflictions 
he is afflicted, and like as a father pitieth his children, so doth 
he pity you. The meanest interests of all his saints are all borne 
upon the broad bosom of the Son of God. Oh, what a heart is his, that 
doth not merely comprehend the persons of his people, but comprehends 
also the diverse and innumerable concerns of all those persons! Dost 
thou think, O Christian, that thou canst measure the love of Christ? 
Think of what his love has brought thee—justification, adoption, sanctification, eternal life! The riches 
of his goodness are unsearchable; thou shalt never be able to tell 
them out or even conceive them. Oh, the breadth of the love of Christ! 
Shall such a love as this have half our hearts? Shall it have a cold 
love in return? Shall Jesus’ marvellous lovingkindness and tender care meet with but faint response 
and tardy acknowledgment? O my soul, tune thy harp to a glad song 
of thanksgiving! Go to thy rest rejoicing, for thou art no desolate 
wanderer, but a beloved child, watched over, cared for, supplied, 
and defended by thy Lord.</p>

of Israel of old. There are those who, when the rod falls, cry out 
against the afflictive dispensation. They ask, “Why am I thus afflicted? What have I done to be chastened in this 
manner?” A word with thee, O murmurer! Why shouldst thou murmur against the 
dispensations of thy heavenly Father? Can he treat thee more hardly 
than thou deservest? Consider what a rebel thou wast once, but he 
has pardoned thee! Surely, if he in his wisdom sees fit now to chasten 
thee, thou shouldst not complain. After all, art thou smitten as hardly 
as thy sins deserve? Consider the corruption which is in thy breast, 
and then wilt thou wonder that there needs so much of the rod to fetch 
it out? Weigh thyself, and discern how much dross is mingled with 
thy gold; and dost thou think the fire too hot to purge away so much 
dross as thou hast? Does not that proud rebellious spirit of thine 
prove that thy heart is not thoroughly sanctified? Are not those murmuring 
words contrary to the holy submissive nature of God’s children? Is not the correction needed? But if thou <i>wilt</i> murmur against the chastening, take heed, for it will go hard with 
murmurers. God always chastises his children twice, if they do not 
bear the first stroke patiently. But know one thing—“He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.” All his corrections are sent in love, to purify thee, and to draw 
thee nearer to himself. Surely it must help thee to bear the chastening 
with resignation if thou art able to recognize thy <i>Father's</i> hand. For “whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he 
receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons.” “Murmur not as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the 
destroyer.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0430pm-p3">Divine omniscience affords no comfort to the ungodly mind, but to 
the child of God it overflows with consolation. God is always thinking 
upon us, never turns aside his mind from us, has us always before 
his eyes; and this is precisely as we would have it, for it would 
be dreadful to exist for a moment beyond the observation of our heavenly 
Father. His thoughts are always tender, loving, wise, prudent, far-reaching, 
and they bring to us countless benefits: hence it is a choice delight 
to remember them. The Lord always did think upon his people: hence 
their election and the covenant of grace by which their salvation 
is secured; he always will think upon them: hence their final perseverance 
by which they shall be brought safely to their final rest. In all 
our wanderings the watchful glance of the Eternal Watcher is evermore 
fixed upon us—we never roam beyond the Shepherd’s eye. In our sorrows he observes us incessantly, and not a pang escapes 
him; in our toils he marks all our weariness, and writes in his book 
all the struggles of his faithful ones. These thoughts of the Lord 
encompass us in all our paths, and penetrate the innermost region 
of our being. Not a nerve or tissue, valve or vessel, of our bodily 
organization is uncared for; all the littles of our little world are 
thought upon by the great God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0430pm-p4">Dear reader, is this precious to you? then hold to it. Never be led 
astray by those philosophic fools who preach up an impersonal God, 
and talk of self-existent, self-governing matter. The Lord liveth 
and thinketh upon us, this is a truth far too precious for us to be 
lightly robbed of it. The notice of a nobleman is valued so highly 
that he who has it counts his fortune made; but what is it to be thought 
of by the King of kings! If the Lord thinketh upon us, all is well, 
and we may rejoice evermore.</p>

done their work, and the earth is all bedecked with beauty. Come my 
soul, put on thine holiday attire and go forth to gather garlands 
of heavenly thoughts. Thou knowest whither to betake thyself, for 
to thee “the beds of spices” are well known, and thou hast so often smelt the perfume of “the sweet flowers,” that thou wilt go at once to thy well-beloved and find all loveliness, 
all joy in him. That cheek once so rudely smitten with a rod, oft 
bedewed with tears of sympathy and then defiled with spittle—that cheek as it smiles with mercy is as fragrant aromatic to my heart. 
Thou didst not hide thy face from shame and spitting, O Lord Jesus, 
and therefore I will find my dearest delight in praising thee. Those 
cheeks were furrowed by the plough of grief, and crimsoned with red 
lines of blood from thy thorn-crowned temples; such marks of love 
unbounded cannot but charm my soul far more than “pillars of perfume.” If I may not see the whole of his face I would behold his cheeks, 
for the least glimpse of him is exceedingly refreshing to my spiritual 
sense and yields a variety of delights. In Jesus I find not only fragrance, 
but a bed of spices; not one flower, but all manner of sweet flowers. 
He is to me my rose and my lily, my heartsease and my cluster of camphire. 
When he is with me it is May all the year round, and my soul goes 
forth to wash her happy face in the morning-dew of his grace, and 
to solace herself with the singing of the birds of his promises. Precious 
Lord Jesus, let me in very deed know the blessedness which dwells 
in abiding, unbroken fellowship with thee. I am a poor worthless one, 
whose cheek thou hast deigned to kiss! O let me kiss thee in return

<p class="normal" id="d0501pm-p3">Whatever there may be of beauty in the material world, Jesus Christ 
possesses all that in the spiritual world in a tenfold degree. Amongst 
flowers the rose is deemed the sweetest, but Jesus is infinitely more 
beautiful in the garden of the soul than the rose can be in the gardens 
of earth. He takes the first place as the fairest among ten thousand. 
He is the sun, and all others are the stars; the heavens and the day 
are dark in comparison with him, <i>for the King in his beauty transcends</i> <i>all</i>. “I am the rose of <i>Sharon</i>.” This was the best and rarest of roses. Jesus is not “the rose” alone, he is “the rose of Sharon,” just as he calls his righteousness “gold,” and then adds, “the gold of Ophir”—the best of the best. He is positively lovely, and superlatively the 
loveliest. <i>There is</i> <i>variety in his charms</i>. The rose is delightful to the eye, and its scent is pleasant and 
refreshing; so each of the senses of the soul, whether it be the taste 
or feeling, the hearing, the sight, or the spiritual smell, finds 
appropriate gratification in Jesus. <i>Even the recollection of his love is</i> <i>sweet</i>. Take the rose of Sharon, and pull it leaf from leaf, and lay by 
the leaves in the jar of memory, and you shall find each leaf fragrant 
long afterwards, filling the house with perfume. Christ <i>satisfies the highest taste</i> of the most educated spirit to the very full. The greatest amateur 
in perfumes is quite satisfied with the rose: and when the soul has 
arrived at her highest pitch of true taste, she shall still be content 
with Christ, nay, she shall be the better able to appreciate him. 
Heaven itself possesses nothing which excels the rose of Sharon. What 
emblem can fully set forth his beauty? Human speech and earth-born 
things fail to tell of him. Earth’s choicest charms commingled, feebly picture his abounding preciousness. 
Blessed rose, bloom in my heart forever!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0502am-p3">It is a sweet and blessed event which will occur to all believers 
in God’s own time—the going home to be with Jesus. In a few more years the Lord’s soldiers, who are now fighting “the good fight of faith” will have done with conflict, and have entered into the joy of their 
Lord. But although Christ prays that his people may eventually be 
with him where he is, he does not ask that they may be taken at once 
away from this world to heaven. He wishes them to stay here. Yet how 
frequently does the wearied pilgrim put up the prayer, “O that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at 
rest;” but Christ does not pray like that, he leaves us in his Father’s hands, until, like shocks of corn fully ripe, we shall each be gathered 
into our Master’s garner. Jesus does not plead for our instant removal by death, for 
to abide in the flesh is needful for others if not profitable for 
ourselves. He asks that we may be kept from evil, but he never asks 
for us to be admitted to the inheritance in glory till we are of full 
age. Christians often want to die when they have any trouble. Ask 
them why, and they tell you, “Because we would be with the Lord.” We fear it is not so much because they are longing to be with the 
Lord, as because they desire to get rid of their troubles; else they 
would feel the same wish to die at other times when not under the 
pressure of trial. They want to go home, not so much for the Saviour’s company, as to be at rest. Now it is quite right to desire to depart 
if we can do it in the same spirit that Paul did, because to be with 
Christ is far better, but the wish to escape from trouble is a selfish 
one. Rather let your care and wish be to glorify God by your life 
here as long as he pleases, even though it be in the midst of toil, 
and conflict, and suffering, and leave him to say when “it is enough.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0502pm-p3">Behold the epitaph of all those blessed saints who fell asleep before 
the coming of our Lord! It matters nothing how else they died, whether 
of old age, or by violent means; this one point, in which they all 
agree, is the most worthy of record, “they all died in faith.” In faith they lived—it was their comfort, their guide, their motive and their support; 
and in the same spiritual grace they died, ending their life-song 
in the sweet strain in which they had so long continued. They did 
not die resting in the flesh or upon their own attainments; they made 
no advance from their first way of acceptance with God, but held to 
the way of faith to the end. Faith is as precious to die by as to 
live by.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0502pm-p4">Dying in faith has distinct reference to <i>the past</i>. They believed the promises which had gone before, and were assured 
that their sins were blotted out through the mercy of God. Dying in 
faith has to do with <i>the present</i>. These saints were confident of their acceptance with God, they enjoyed 
the beams of his love, and rested in his faithfulness. Dying in faith 
looks into <i>the future</i>. They fell asleep, affirming that the Messiah would surely come, 
and that when he would in the last days appear upon the earth, they 
would rise from their graves to behold him. To them the pains of death 
were but the birth-pangs of a better state. Take courage, my soul, 
as thou readest this epitaph. Thy course, through grace, is one of 
faith, and sight seldom cheers thee; this has also been the pathway 
of the brightest and the best. Faith was the orbit in which these 
stars of the first magnitude moved all the time of their shining here; 
and happy art thou that it is thine. Look anew tonight to Jesus, the 
author and finisher of thy faith, and thank Him for giving thee like 
precious faith with souls now in glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0503am-p3">Art thou asking the reason of this, believer? Look upward to thy heavenly 
Father, and behold him pure and holy. Dost thou know that thou art 
one day to be like him? Wilt thou easily be conformed to his image? 
Wilt thou not require much refining in the furnace of affliction to 
purify thee? Will it be an easy thing to get rid of thy corruptions, 
and make thee perfect even as thy Father which is in heaven is perfect? 
Next, Christian, turn thine eye <i>downward</i>. Dost thou know what foes thou hast beneath thy feet? Thou wast once 
a servant of Satan, and no king will willingly lose his subjects. 
Dost thou think that Satan will let thee alone? No, he will be always 
at thee, for he “goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.” Expect trouble, therefore, Christian, when thou lookest beneath thee. 
Then look <i>around thee</i>. Where art thou? Thou art in an enemy’s country, a stranger and a sojourner. The world is not thy friend. 
If it be, then thou art not God’s friend, for he who is the friend of the world is the enemy of God. 
Be assured that thou shalt find foe-men everywhere. When thou sleepest, 
think that thou art resting on the battlefield; when thou walkest, 
suspect an ambush in every hedge. As mosquitoes are said to bite strangers 
more than natives, so will the trials of earth be sharpest to you. 
Lastly, look <i>within thee</i>, into thine own heart and observe what is there. <i>Sin</i> and <i>self</i> are still within. Ah! if thou hadst no devil to tempt thee, no enemies 
to fight thee, and no world to ensnare thee, thou wouldst still find 
in thyself evil enough to be a sore trouble to thee, for “the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.” Expect trouble then, but despond not on account of it, for God is 
with thee to help and to strengthen thee. He hath said, “I will be with thee in trouble; I will deliver thee and honour thee.”</p>

Even our Lord Jesus is given to us for our present use. Believer, 
thou dost not make use of Christ as thou oughtest to do. When thou 
art in trouble, why dost thou not tell him all thy grief? Has he not 
a sympathizing heart, and can he not comfort and relieve thee? No, 
thou art going about to all thy friends, save thy best Friend, and 
telling thy tale everywhere except into the bosom of thy Lord. Art 
thou burdened with this day’s sins? Here is a fountain filled with blood: use it, saint, use it. 
Has a sense of guilt returned upon thee? The pardoning grace of Jesus 
may be proved again and again. Come to him at once for cleansing. 
Dost thou deplore thy weakness? He is thy strength: why not lean upon 
him? Dost thou feel naked? Come hither, soul; put on the robe of Jesus’ righteousness. Stand not looking at it, but wear it. Strip off thine 
own righteousness, and thine own fears too: put on the fair white 
linen, for it was meant to <i>wear</i>. Dost thou feel thyself sick? Pull the night-bell of prayer, and 
call up the Beloved Physician! He will give the cordial that will 
revive thee. Thou art poor, but then thou hast “a kinsman, a mighty man of wealth.” What! wilt thou not go to him, and ask him to give thee of his abundance, 
when he has given thee this promise, that thou shalt be joint heir 
with him, and has made over all that he is and all that he has to 
be thine? There is nothing Christ dislikes more than for his people 
to make a show-thing of him, and not to use him. He loves to be employed 
by us. The more burdens we put on his shoulders, the more precious 
will he be to us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0504am-p3">One great besetting sin of ancient Israel was idolatry, and the spiritual 
Israel are vexed with a tendency to the same folly. Remphan’s star shines no longer, and the women weep no more for Tammuz, but 
Mammon still intrudes his golden calf, and the shrines of pride are 
not forsaken. Self in various forms struggles to subdue the chosen 
ones under its dominion, and the flesh sets up its altars wherever 
it can find space for them. Favourite children are often the cause 
of much sin in believers; the Lord is grieved when he sees us doting 
upon them above measure; they will live to be as great a curse to 
us as Absalom was to David, or they will be taken from us to leave 
our homes desolate. If Christians desire to grow thorns to stuff their 
sleepless pillows, let them dote on their dear ones.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0504am-p4">It is truly said that “they are no gods,” for the objects of our foolish love are very doubtful blessings, 
the solace which they yield us now is dangerous, and the help which 
they can give us in the hour of trouble is little indeed. Why, then, 
are we so bewitched with vanities? We pity the poor heathen who adore 
a god of stone, and yet worship a god of gold. Where is the vast superiority 
between a god of flesh and one of wood? The principle, the sin, the 
folly is the same in either case, only that in ours the crime is more 
aggravated because we have more light, and sin in the face of it. 
The heathen bows to a false deity, but the true God he has never known; 
we commit two evils, inasmuch as we forsake the living God and turn 
unto idols. May the Lord purge us all from this grievous iniquity!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0504pm-p3">Peter most earnestly exhorted the scattered saints to love each other 
“with a pure heart fervently” and he wisely fetched his argument, not from the law, from nature, 
or from philosophy, but from that high and divine nature which God 
hath implanted in his people. Just as some judicious tutor of princes 
might labour to beget and foster in them a kingly spirit and dignified 
behaviour, finding arguments in their position and descent, so, looking 
upon God’s people as heirs of glory, princes of the blood royal, descendants 
of the King of kings, earth’s truest and oldest aristocracy, Peter saith to them, “See that ye love one another, because of your noble birth, being born 
of incorruptible seed; because of your pedigree, being descended from 
God, the Creator of all things; and because of your immortal destiny, 
for you shall never pass away, though the glory of the flesh shall 
fade, and even its existence shall cease.” It would be well if, in the spirit of humility, we recognized the 
true dignity of our regenerated nature, and lived up to it. What is 
a Christian? If you compare him with a king, he adds priestly sanctity 
to royal dignity. The king’s royalty often lieth only in his crown, but with a Christian it is 
infused into his inmost nature. He is as much above his fellows through 
his new birth, as a man is above the beast that perisheth. Surely 
he ought to carry himself, in all his dealings, as one who is not 
of the multitude, but chosen out of the world, distinguished by sovereign 
grace, written among “the peculiar people” and who therefore cannot grovel in the dust as others, nor live after 
the manner of the world’s citizens. Let the dignity of your nature, and the brightness of 
your prospects, O believers in Christ, constrain you to cleave unto 
holiness, and to avoid the very appearance of evil.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0505am-p3">What a sweet title: “My people!” What a cheering revelation: “Their God!” How much of meaning is couched in those two words, “My people!” Here is <i>speciality</i>. The whole world is God's; the heaven, even the heaven of heavens 
is the Lord's, and he reigneth among the children of men; but of those 
whom he hath chosen, whom he hath purchased to himself, he saith what 
he saith not of others—“My people.” In this word there is the idea of <i>proprietorship</i>. In a special manner the “Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.” All the nations upon earth are his; the whole world is in his power; 
yet are his people, his chosen, more especially his possession; for 
he has done more for them than others; he has bought them with his 
blood; he has brought them nigh to himself; he has set his great heart 
upon them; he has loved them with an everlasting love, a love which 
many waters cannot quench, and which the revolutions of time shall 
never suffice in the least degree to diminish. Dear friends, can you, 
by faith, see yourselves in that number? Can you look up to heaven 
and say, “My Lord and my God: mine by that sweet <i>relationship</i> which entitles me to call thee Father; mine by that hallowed <i>fellowship</i> which I delight to hold with thee when thou art pleased to manifest 
thyself unto me as thou dost not unto the world?” Canst thou read the Book of Inspiration, and find there the indentures 
of thy salvation? Canst thou read thy title writ in precious blood? 
Canst thou, by humble faith, lay hold of Jesus’ garments, and say, “My Christ”? If thou canst, then God saith of thee, and of others like thee, “My people;” for, if God be your God, and Christ your Christ, the Lord has a special, 
peculiar favour to you; you are the object of his choice, accepted 
in his beloved Son.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0505pm-p3">Wisdom is man’s true strength; and, under its guidance, he best accomplishes the 
ends of his being. Wisely handling the matter of life gives to man 
the richest enjoyment, and presents the noblest occupation for his 
powers; hence by it he finds good in the fullest sense. Without wisdom, 
man is as the wild ass’s colt, running hither and thither, wasting strength which might be 
profitably employed. Wisdom is the compass by which man is to steer 
across the trackless waste of life; without it he is a derelict vessel, 
the sport of winds and waves. A man must be prudent in such a world 
as this, or he will find no good, but be betrayed into unnumbered 
ills. The pilgrim will sorely wound his feet among the briers of the 
wood of life if he does not pick his steps with the utmost caution. 
He who is in a wilderness infested with robber bands must handle matters 
wisely if he would journey safely. If, trained by the Great Teacher, 
we follow where he leads, we shall find good, even while in this dark 
abode; there are celestial fruits to be gathered this side of Eden’s bowers, and songs of paradise to be sung amid the groves of earth. 
But where shall this wisdom be found? Many have dreamed of it, but 
have not possessed it. Where shall we learn it? Let us listen to the 
voice of the Lord, for he hath declared the secret; he hath revealed 
to the sons of men wherein true wisdom lieth, and we have it in the 
text, “Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.” <i>The true way to handle a matter wisely is</i> <i>to trust in the Lord</i>. This is the sure clue to the most intricate labyrinths of life; 
follow it and find eternal bliss. He who trusts in the Lord has a 
diploma for wisdom granted by inspiration: happy is he now, and happier 
shall he be above. Lord, in this sweet eventide walk with me in the 
garden, and teach me the wisdom of faith.</p>

weary, you can find rest with Jesus; and from it you can look out

come; and though the house is too good for you, Christ will make you 
good enough for the house by-and-by. He will wash you and cleanse 
you, and you will yet be able to sing, “We dwell in him.” Believer: thrice happy art thou to have such a dwelling-place! Greatly 
privileged thou art, for thou hast a “strong habitation” in which thou art ever safe. And “dwelling in him,” thou hast not only a perfect and secure house, but an <i>everlasting</i> one. When this world shall have melted like a dream, our house shall

give a relish to the new wine which sparkles in the golden bowls of 
glory. Our battered armour and scarred countenances will render more 
illustrious our victory above, when we are welcomed to the seats of 
those who have overcome the world. We should not have full <i>fellowship with Christ</i> if we did not for awhile sojourn below, for he was baptized with 
a baptism of suffering among men, and we must be baptized with the 
same if we would share his kingdom. Fellowship with Christ is so honourable 
that the sorest sorrow is a light price by which to procure it. Another 
reason for our lingering here is <i>for the good of</i> <i>others</i>. We would not wish to enter heaven till our work is done, and it 
may be that we are yet ordained to minister light to souls benighted 
in the wilderness of sin. Our prolonged stay here is doubtless <i>for God’s glory</i>. A tried saint, like a well-cut diamond, glitters much in the King’s crown. Nothing reflects so much honour on a workman as a protracted 
and severe trial of his work, and its triumphant endurance of the 
ordeal without giving way in any part. We are God’s workmanship, in whom he will be glorified by our afflictions. It 
is for the honour of Jesus that we endure the trial of our faith with 
sacred joy. Let each man surrender his own longings to the glory of 
Jesus, and feel, “If my lying in the dust would elevate my Lord by so much as an inch, 
let me still lie among the pots of earth. If to live on earth forever 
would make my Lord more glorious, it should be my heaven to be shut 
out of heaven.” Our time is fixed and settled by eternal decree. Let us not be anxious

at his feet! What sickening ulcers and putrefying sores! Yet he was 
ready for every new shape of the monster evil, and was victor over 
it in every form. Let the arrow fly from what quarter it might, he

<p class="normal" id="d0507pm-p3">Like many others, the impotent man had been waiting for a wonder to 
be wrought, and a sign to be given. Wearily did he watch the pool, 
but no angel came, or came not for him; yet, thinking it to be his 
only chance, he waited still, and knew not that there was One near 
him whose word could heal him in a moment. Many are in the same plight: 
they are waiting for some singular emotion, remarkable impression, 
or celestial vision; they wait in vain and watch for nought. Even 
supposing that, in a few cases, remarkable signs are seen, yet these 
are rare, and no man has a right to look for them in his own case; 
no man especially who feels his impotency to avail himself of the 
moving of the water even if it came. It is a very sad reflection that 
tens of thousands are now waiting in the use of means, and ordinances, 
and vows, and resolutions, and have so waited time out of mind, in 
vain, utterly in vain. Meanwhile these poor souls forget the present 
Saviour, who bids them look unto him and be saved. He could heal them 
at once, but they prefer to wait for an angel and a wonder. To trust 
him is the sure way to every blessing, and he is worthy of the most 
implicit confidence; but unbelief makes them prefer the cold porches 
of Bethesda to the warm bosom of his love. O that the Lord may turn 
his eye upon the multitudes who are in this case tonight; may he forgive 
the slights which they put upon his divine power, and call them by 
that sweet constraining voice, to rise from the bed of despair, and 
in the energy of faith take up their bed and walk. O Lord, hear our 
prayer for all such at this calm hour of sunset, and ere the day breaketh 
may they look and live.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0508am-p3">Years are short to the happy and healthy; but thirty-eight years of 
disease must have dragged a very weary length along the life of the 
poor impotent man. When Jesus, therefore, healed him by a word, while 
he lay at the pool of Bethesda, he was delightfully <i>sensible of a change</i>. Even so the sinner who has for weeks and months been paralysed with 
despair, and has wearily sighed for salvation, is very conscious of 
the change when the Lord Jesus speaks the word of power, and gives 
joy and peace in believing. The evil removed is too great to be removed 
without our discerning it; the life imparted is too remarkable to 
be possessed and remain inoperative; and the change wrought is too 
marvellous not to be perceived. Yet the poor man was <i>ignorant of the author</i> of his cure; he knew not the sacredness of his person, the offices 
which he sustained, or the errand which brought him among men. Much 
ignorance of Jesus may remain in hearts which yet feel the power of 
his blood. We must not hastily condemn men for lack of knowledge; 
but where we can see the faith which saves the soul, we must believe 
that salvation has been bestowed. The Holy Spirit makes men penitents 
long before he makes them divines; and he who believes what he knows, 
shall soon know more clearly what he believes. Ignorance is, however, 
an evil; for this poor man was much <i>tantalized by</i> <i>the Pharisees</i>, and was quite unable to cope with them. It is good to be able to 
answer gainsayers; but we cannot do so if we know not the Lord Jesus 
clearly and with understanding. The cure of his ignorance, however, 
soon followed the cure of his infirmity, for he was <i>visited by the Lord in the temple</i>; and after that gracious manifestation, he was <i>found testifying</i> that “it was Jesus who had made him whole.” Lord, if thou hast saved me, show me thyself, that I may declare 
thee to the sons of men.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0508pm-p3">If we would rightly “acquaint ourselves with God, and be at peace,” we must know him as he has revealed himself, not only in <i>the unity of his essence and subsistence</i>, but also in <i>the</i> <i>plurality of his persons</i>. God said, “Let us make man in our own image”—let not man be content until he knows something of the “us” from whom his being was derived. Endeavour to know the Father; bury 
your head in his bosom in deep repentance, and confess that you are 
not worthy to be called his son; receive the kiss of his love; let 
the ring which is the token of his eternal faithfulness be on your 
finger; sit at his table and let your heart make merry in his grace. 
Then press forward and seek to know much of <i>the Son</i> of God who is the brightness of his Father’s glory, and yet in unspeakable condescension of grace became man 
for our sakes; know him in the singular complexity of his nature: 
eternal God, and yet suffering, finite man; follow him as he walks 
the waters with the tread of deity, and as he sits upon the well in 
the weariness of humanity. Be not satisfied unless you know much of 
Jesus Christ as your Friend, your Brother, your Husband, your all. 
Forget not <i>the Holy</i> <i>Spirit</i>; endeavour to obtain a clear view of his nature and character, his 
attributes, and his works. Behold that Spirit of the Lord, who first 
of all moved upon chaos, and brought forth order; who now visits the 
chaos of your soul, and creates the order of holiness. Behold him 
as the Lord and giver of spiritual life, the Illuminator, the Instructor, 
the Comforter, and the Sanctifier. Behold him as, like holy unction, 
he descends upon the head of Jesus, and then afterwards rests upon 
<i>you</i> who are as the skirts of his garments. Such an intelligent, scriptural, 
and experimental belief in the Trinity in Unity is yours if you truly 
know God; and such knowledge <i>brings peace</i> <i>indeed</i>.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0509am-p3">All the goodness of the past, the present, and the future, Christ 
bestows upon his people. In the mysterious ages of the past the Lord 
Jesus was his Father’s first elect, and in his <i>election</i> he gave us an interest, for we were chosen in him from before the 
foundation of the world. He had from all eternity the prerogatives 
of <i>Sonship</i>, as his Father’s only-begotten and well-beloved Son, and he has, in the riches of 
his grace, by adoption and regeneration, elevated us to sonship also, 
so that to us he has given “power to become the sons of God.” The <i>eternal covenant</i>, based upon suretiship and confirmed by oath, is ours, for our strong 
consolation and security. In the <i>everlasting settlements of predestinating</i> <i>wisdom</i> and omnipotent decree, the eye of the Lord Jesus was ever fixed on 
us; and we may rest assured that in the whole roll of destiny there 
is not a line which militates against the interests of his redeemed. 
The <i>great betrothal</i> of the Prince of Glory is ours, for it is to us that he is affianced, 
as the sacred nuptials shall ere long declare to an assembled universe. 
The <i>marvellous incarnation</i> of the God of heaven, with all the amazing condescension and humiliation 
which attended it, is ours. The bloody sweat, the scourge, the cross, 
are ours forever. Whatever blissful consequences flow from <i>perfect</i> <i>obedience, finished atonement, resurrection, ascension, or</i> <i>intercession</i>, all are ours by his own gift. Upon his breastplate he is now bearing 
our names; and in his authoritative pleadings at the throne he remembers 
our persons and pleads our cause. His <i>dominion</i> over principalities and powers, and his absolute majesty in heaven, 
he employs for the benefit of them who trust in him. His high estate 
is as much at our service as was his condition of abasement. He who 
gave himself for us in the depths of woe and death, doth not withdraw 
the grant now that he is enthroned in the highest heavens.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0509pm-p3">The church was about to engage in earnest labour, and desired her 
Lord’s company in it. She does not say, “I will go,” but “let us go.” It is blessed working when Jesus is at our side! It is the business 
of God’s people to be trimmers of God’s vines. Like our first parents, we are put into the garden of the 
Lord for usefulness; let us therefore go forth into the field. Observe 
that the church, when she is in her right mind, in all her many labours 
desires to enjoy communion with Christ. Some imagine that they cannot 
serve Christ actively, and yet have fellowship with him: they are 
mistaken. Doubtless it is very easy to fritter away our inward life 
in outward exercises, and come to complain with the spouse, “They made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I 
not kept;” but there is no reason why this should be the case except our own 
folly and neglect. Certain is it that a professor may do nothing, 
and yet grow quite as lifeless in spiritual things as those who are 
most busy. Mary was not praised for sitting still; but for her <i>sitting at Jesus’ feet</i>. Even so, Christians are not to be praised for neglecting duties 
under the pretence of having secret fellowship with Jesus: it is not 
sitting, but sitting at Jesus’ feet which is commendable. Do not think that activity is in itself 
an evil: it is a great blessing, and a means of grace to us. Paul 
called it a grace given to him to be allowed to preach; and every 
form of Christian service may become a personal blessing to those 
engaged in it. Those who have most fellowship with Christ are not 
recluses or hermits, who have much time to spare, but indefatigable 
labourers who are toiling for Jesus, and who, in their toil, have 
him side by side with them, so that they are workers together with 
God. Let us remember then, in anything we have to do for Jesus, that 
we can do it, and should do it in close communion with him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0510am-p3">The whole system of Christianity rests upon the fact that “Christ is risen from the dead;” for, “If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith 
is also vain: ye are yet in your sins.” The <i>divinity</i> of Christ finds its surest proof in his resurrection, since he was 
“Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit 
of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.” It would not be unreasonable to doubt his deity if he had not risen. 
Moreover, Christ’s <i>sovereignty</i> depends upon his resurrection, “For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might 
be Lord both of the dead and living.” Again, our <i>justification</i>, that choice blessing of the covenant, is linked with Christ’s triumphant victory over death and the grave; for “He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.” Nay, more, our very <i>regeneration</i> is connected with his resurrection, for we are “Begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ 
from the dead.” And most certainly our <i>ultimate resurrection</i> rests here, for, “If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, 
he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal 
bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.” If Christ be not risen, then shall we not rise; but if he be risen 
then they who are asleep in Christ have not perished, but in their 
flesh shall surely behold their God. Thus, the silver thread of resurrection 
runs through all the believer’s blessings, from his regeneration onwards to his eternal glory, and 
binds them together. How important then will this glorious fact be 
in his estimation, and how will he rejoice that beyond a doubt it 
is established, that “now is Christ risen from the dead”!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0510pm-p3">Believer, you can bear your testimony that Christ is <i>the</i> <i>only begotten of the Father</i>, as well as the first begotten from the dead. You can say, “He is divine to me, if he be human to all the world beside. He has 
done that for me which none but a God could do. He has subdued my 
stubborn will, melted a heart of adamant, opened gates of brass, and 
snapped bars of iron. He hath turned for me my mourning into laughter,

when I struggled to escape from his grace; and when at last I came 
all trembling like a condemned culprit to his mercy-seat, he said, 
‘Thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee: be of good cheer.’ And he is <i>full of truth</i>. True have his promises been, not one has failed. I bear witness 
that never servant had such a master as I have; never brother such 
a kinsman as he has been to me; never spouse such a husband as Christ 
has been to my soul; never sinner a better Saviour; never mourner 
a better comforter than Christ hath been to my spirit. I want none

of death; in poverty Christ is my riches; in sickness he makes my 
bed; in darkness he is my star, and in brightness he is my sun; he 
is the manna of the camp in the wilderness, and he shall be the new 
corn of the host when they come to Canaan. Jesus is to me all grace

is <i>full</i>, infinitely full. My soul, this night, bless with all thy might ‘the only Begotten.’”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0511pm-p3">Our God’s tender love for his servants makes him concerned for the state of 
their inward feelings. He desires them to be of good courage. Some 
esteem it a small thing for a believer to be vexed with doubts and 
fears, but God thinks not so. From this text it is plain that our 
Master would not have us entangled with fears. He would have us without 
carefulness, without doubt, without cowardice. Our Master does not 
think so lightly of our unbelief as we do. When we are desponding 
we are subject to a grievous malady, not to be trifled with, but to 
be carried at once to the beloved Physician. Our Lord loveth not to 
see our countenance sad. It was a law of Ahasuerus that no one should 
come into the king’s court dressed in mourning: this is not the law of the King of kings, 
for we may come mourning as we are; but still he would have us put 
off the spirit of heaviness, and put on the garment of praise, for 
there is much reason to rejoice. The Christian man ought to be of 
a courageous spirit, in order that he may glorify the Lord by enduring 
trials in an heroic manner. If he be fearful and fainthearted, <i>it will</i> <i>dishonour his God</i>. Besides, <i>what a bad example it is</i>. This disease of doubtfulness and discouragement is an epidemic which 
soon spreads amongst the Lord’s flock. One downcast believer makes twenty souls sad. Moreover, unless 
your courage is kept up, <i>Satan will be too much for you</i>. Let your spirit be joyful in God your Saviour, the joy of the Lord 
shall be your strength, and no fiend of hell shall make headway against 
you; but cowardice throws down the banner. Moreover, <i>labour is</i> <i>light</i> to a man of cheerful spirit; and <i>success waits upon</i> <i>cheerfulness</i>. The man who toils, rejoicing in his God, believing with all his 
heart, has success guaranteed. He who sows in hope shall reap in joy; 
therefore, dear reader, “be thou strong, and very courageous.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0512am-p3">The Lord Jesus gives special revelations of himself to his people. 
Even if Scripture did not declare this, there are many of the children 
of God who could testify the truth of it from their own experience. 
They have had manifestations of their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ 
in a peculiar manner, such as no mere reading or hearing could afford. 
In the biographies of eminent saints, you will find many instances 
recorded in which Jesus has been pleased, in a very special manner 
to speak to their souls, and to unfold the wonders of his person; 
yea, so have their souls been steeped in happiness that they have 
thought themselves to be in heaven, whereas they were not there, though 
they were well nigh on the threshold of it—for when Jesus manifests himself to his people, it is heaven on earth; 
it is paradise in embryo; it is bliss begun. Especial manifestations 
of Christ exercise a holy influence on the believer’s heart. One effect will be <i>humility</i>. If a man says, “I have had such-and-such spiritual communications, I am a great man,” he has never had any communion with Jesus at all; for “God hath respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth <i>afar off</i>.” He does not need to come near them to know them, and will never give 
them any visits of love. Another effect will be <i>happiness</i>; for in God’s presence there are pleasures for evermore. <i>Holiness</i> will be sure to follow. A man who has no holiness has never had this 
manifestation. Some men profess a great deal; but we must not believe 
any one unless we see that his deeds answer to what he says. “Be not deceived; God is not mocked.” He will not bestow his favours upon the wicked: for while he will 
not cast away a perfect man, neither will he respect an evil doer. 
Thus there will be three effects of nearness to Jesus—humility, happiness, and holiness. May God give them to thee, Christian!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0512pm-p3">Jacob must have shuddered at the thought of leaving the land of his 
father’s sojourning, and dwelling among heathen strangers. It was <i>a new scene, and likely to be a trying</i> <i>one</i>: who shall venture among couriers of a foreign monarch without anxiety? 
Yet the way was <i>evidently appointed</i> for him, and therefore he resolved to go. This is frequently the 
position of believers now—they are called to perils and temptations altogether untried: at such 
seasons <i>let them</i> <i>imitate Jacob’s example</i> by offering sacrifices of prayer unto God, and seeking his direction; 
let them not take a step until they have waited upon the Lord for 
his blessing: then they <i>will have Jacob’s companion</i> to be their friend and helper. How blessed to feel assured that the 
Lord is with us in all our ways, and condescends to go down into our 
humiliations and banishments with us! Even beyond the ocean our Father’s love beams like the sun in its strength. We cannot hesitate to go 
where Jehovah promises his presence; even the valley of deathshade 
grows bright with the radiance of this assurance. Marching onwards 
with faith in their God, believers <i>shall have</i> <i>Jacob’s promise</i>. They shall be brought up again, whether it be from the troubles 
of life or the chambers of death. Jacob’s seed came out of Egypt in due time, and so shall all the faithful 
pass unscathed through the tribulation of life, and the terror of 
death. Let us <i>exercise Jacob’s confidence. “Fear</i> <i>not</i>,” is the Lord’s command and his divine encouragement to those who at his bidding 
are launching upon new seas; the divine presence and preservation 
forbid so much as one unbelieving fear. Without our God we should 
fear to move; but when he bids us to, it would be dangerous to tarry. 
Reader, go forward, and fear not.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0513pm-p3">Look at thy possessions, O believer, and compare thy portion with 
the lot of thy fellowmen. Some of them have their portion in the field; 
they are rich, and their harvests yield them a golden increase; but 
what are harvests compared with thy God, who is the God of harvests? 
What are bursting granaries compared with him, who is the Husbandman, 
and feeds thee with the bread of heaven? Some have their portion in 
the city; their wealth is abundant, and flows to them in constant 
streams, until they become a very reservoir of gold; but what is gold 
compared with thy God? Thou couldst not live on it; thy spiritual 
life could not be sustained by it. Put it on a troubled conscience, 
and could it allay its pangs? Apply it to a desponding heart, and 
see if it could stay a solitary groan, or give one grief the less? 
But thou hast God, and in him thou hast more than gold or riches ever 
could buy. Some have their portion in that which most men love—applause and fame; but ask thyself, is not thy God more to thee than 
that? What if a myriad clarions should be loud in thine applause, 
would this prepare thee to pass the Jordan, or cheer thee in prospect 
of judgment? No, there are griefs in life which wealth cannot alleviate; 
and there is the deep need of a dying hour, for which no riches can 
provide. But when thou hast <i>God</i> for thy portion, thou hast more than all else put together. In him 
every want is met, whether in life or in death. With God for thy portion 
thou art rich indeed, for he will supply thy need, comfort thy heart, 
assuage thy grief, guide thy steps, be with thee in the dark valley, 
and then take thee home, to enjoy him as thy portion forever. “I have enough,” said Esau; this is the best thing a worldly man can say, but Jacob 
replies, “I have all things,” which is a note too high for carnal minds.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0514am-p3">The boundless realms of his Father’s universe are Christ’s by prescriptive right. As “heir of all things,” he is the sole proprietor of the vast creation of God, and he has 
admitted us to claim the whole as ours, by virtue of that deed of 
joint-heirship which the Lord hath ratified with his chosen people. 
The golden streets of paradise, the pearly gates, the river of life, 
the transcendent bliss, and the unutterable glory, are, by our blessed 
Lord, made over to us for our everlasting possession. All that he 
has he shares with his people. The crown royal he has placed upon 
the head of his Church, appointing her a kingdom, and calling her 
sons a royal priesthood, a generation of priests and kings. He uncrowned 
himself that we might have a coronation of glory; he would not sit 
upon his own throne until he had procured a place upon it for all 
who overcome by his blood. Crown the head and the whole body shares 
the honour. Behold here the reward of every Christian conqueror! Christ’s throne, crown, sceptre, palace, treasure, robes, heritage, are yours. 
Far superior to the jealousy, selfishness, and greed, which admit 
of no participation of their advantages, Christ deems his happiness 
completed by his people sharing it. “The glory which thou gavest me have I given them.” “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, 
and that your joy might be full.” The smiles of his Father are all the sweeter to him, because his 
people share them. The honours of his kingdom are more pleasing, because 
his people appear with him in glory. More valuable to him are his 
conquests, since they have taught his people to overcome. He delights 
in his throne, because on it there is a place for them. He rejoices 
in his royal robes, since over them his skirts are spread. He delights 
the more in his joy, because he calls them to enter into it.</p>

<i>hallowed</i> <i>familiarity</i>: there are precious love-passages between Christ and his weak ones. 
Here is <i>perfect safety</i>: in his bosom who can hurt them? They must hurt the Shepherd first. 
Here is <i>perfect rest and sweetest comfort</i>. Surely we are not sufficiently sensible of the infinite tenderness 
of Jesus!</p>

soul in the moment when it closes with Christ, and accepts him as 
its all in all. Are they who stand before the throne of God justified 
now?—so are we, as truly and as clearly justified as they who walk in white 
and sing melodious praises to celestial harps. The thief upon the 
cross was justified the moment that he turned the eye of faith to 
Jesus; and Paul, the aged, after years of service, was not more justified 
than was the thief with no service at all. We are <i>today</i> accepted in the Beloved, <i>today</i> absolved from sin, <i>today</i> acquitted at the bar of God. Oh! soul-transporting thought! There

corn of the land, which we can never eat till we cross the Jordan; 
but this is part of the manna in the wilderness, a portion of our

fro. We are <i>now</i>—even <i>now</i> pardoned; even <i>now</i> are our sins put away; even <i>now</i> we stand in the sight of God accepted, as though we had never been 
guilty. “There is therefore <i>now</i> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” There is not a sin in the Book of God, even <i>now</i>, against one of his people. Who dareth to lay anything to their charge? 
There is neither speck, nor spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing 
remaining upon any one believer in the matter of justification in

us to present duty, and now, while life lasts, let us spend and be

of sanctification wrought in him by the Holy Spirit. At present, corruption 
yet remains even in the breasts of the regenerate—experience soon teaches us this. Within us are still lusts and evil 
imaginations. But I rejoice to know that the day is coming when God 
shall finish the work which he has begun; and he shall present my 
soul, not only perfect in Christ, but perfect through the Spirit, 
without spot or blemish, or any such thing. Can it be true that this 
poor sinful heart of mine is to become holy even as God is holy? Can 
it be that this spirit, which often cries, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this 
sin and death?” shall get rid of sin and death—that I shall have no evil things to vex my ears, and no unholy thoughts 
to disturb my peace? Oh, happy hour! may it be hastened! When I cross 
the Jordan, the work of sanctification will be finished; but not till 
that moment shall I even claim perfection in myself. Then my spirit 
shall have its last baptism in the Holy Spirit’s fire. Methinks I long to die to receive that last and final purification 
which shall usher me into heaven. Not an angel more pure than I shall 
be, for I shall be able to say, in a double sense, “I am clean,” through Jesus’ blood, and through the Spirit’s work. Oh, how should we extol the power of the Holy Ghost in thus 
making us fit to stand before our Father in heaven! Yet let not the 
hope of perfection hereafter make us content with imperfection now. 
If it does this, our hope cannot be genuine; for a good hope is a 
purifying thing, even now. The work of grace must be <i>abiding</i> <i>in us now</i> or it cannot be <i>perfected then</i>. Let us pray to “be filled with the Spirit,” that we may bring forth <i>increasingly</i> the fruits of righteousness.</p>

he is manna always falling round the camp; he is a rock in the desert,

his grace is always dropping; the river of his bounty is ever-flowing,

King can never die, so his grace can never fail. Daily we pluck his 
fruit, and daily his branches bend down to our hand with a fresh store 
of mercy. There are seven feast-days in his weeks, and as many as 
are the days, so many are the banquets in his years. Who has ever 
returned from his door unblessed? Who has ever risen from his table 
unsatisfied, or from his bosom un-emparadised? His mercies are new 
every morning and fresh every evening. Who can know the number of 
his benefits, or recount the list of his bounties? Every sand which 
drops from the glass of time is but the tardy follower of a myriad 
of mercies. The wings of our hours are covered with the silver of 
his kindness, and with the yellow gold of his affection. The river 
of time bears from the mountains of eternity the golden sands of his 
favour. The countless stars are but as the standard bearers of a more 
innumerable host of blessings. Who can count the dust of the benefits 
which he bestows on Jacob, or tell the number of the fourth part of 
his mercies towards Israel? How shall my soul extol him who daily 
loadeth us with benefits, and who crowneth us with loving-kindness? 
O that my praise could be as ceaseless as his bounty! O miserable

<p class="normal" id="d0516pm-p3">The armies of the three kings were famishing for want of water: God 
was about to send it, and in these words the prophet announced the 
coming blessing. Here was <i>a case of human</i> <i>helplessness</i>: not a drop of water could all the valiant men procure from the skies 
or find in the wells of earth. Thus often the people of the Lord are 
at their wits’ end; they see the vanity of the creature, and learn experimentally 
where their help is to be found. Still the people were to make <i>a believing</i> <i>preparation for the divine blessing</i>; they were to dig the trenches in which the precious liquid would 
be held. The church must by her varied agencies, efforts, and prayers, 
make herself ready to be blessed; she must make the pools, and the 
Lord will fill them. This must be done in faith, in the full assurance 
that the blessing is about to descend. By-and-by there was <i>a</i> <i>singular bestowal of the needed boon</i>. Not as in Elijah’s case did the shower pour from the clouds, but in a silent and mysterious 
manner the pools were filled. The Lord has his own sovereign modes 
of action: he is not tied to manner and time as we are, but doeth 
as he pleases among the sons of men. It is ours thankfully to receive 
from him, and not to dictate to him. We must also notice <i>the remarkable abundance of the supply</i>—there was enough for the need of all. And so it is in the gospel blessing; 
all the wants of the congregation and of the entire church shall be 
met by the divine power in answer to prayer; and above all this, victory 
shall be speedily given to the armies of the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0517am-p3">Why should Christians imitate Christ? They should do it <i>for</i> <i>their own sakes</i>. If they desire to be in a healthy state of soul—if they would escape the sickness of sin, and enjoy the vigour of 
growing grace, let Jesus be their model. For their own happiness’ sake, if they would drink wine on the lees, well refined; if they 
would enjoy holy and happy communion with Jesus; if they would be 
lifted up above the cares and troubles of this world, let them walk 
even as he walked. There is nothing which can so assist you to walk 
towards heaven with good speed, as wearing the image of Jesus on your 
heart to rule all its motions. It is when, by the power of the Holy 
Spirit, you are enabled to walk with Jesus in his very footsteps, 
that you are most happy, and most known to be the sons of God. Peter 
afar off is both unsafe and uneasy. Next, for <i>religion’s sake</i>, strive to be like Jesus. Ah! poor religion, thou hast been sorely 
shot at by cruel foes, but thou hast not been wounded one-half so 
dangerously by thy foes as by thy friends. Who made those wounds in 
the fair hand of Godliness? The professor who used the dagger of hypocrisy. 
The man who with pretences, enters the fold, being nought but a wolf 
in sheep’s clothing, worries the flock more than the lion outside. There is 
no weapon half so deadly as a Judas-kiss. Inconsistent professors 
injure the gospel more than the sneering critic or the infidel. But, 
especially for <i>Christ’s own sake</i>, imitate his example. Christian, lovest thou thy Saviour? Is his 
name precious to thee? Is his cause dear to thee? Wouldst thou see 
the kingdoms of the world become his? Is it thy desire that he should 
be glorified? Art thou longing that souls should be won to him? If 
so, <i>imitate</i> Jesus; be an “epistle of Christ, known and read of all men.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0517pm-p3">If we have received the grace of God in our hearts, its practical 
effect has been to make us God’s <i>servants</i>. We may be unfaithful servants, we certainly are unprofitable ones, 
but yet, blessed be his name, we <i>are</i> his servants, wearing his livery, feeding at his table, and obeying 
his commands. We were once the servants of sin, but he who made us free has now taken us into his family and taught us obedience 
to his will. We do not serve our Master perfectly, but we would if 
we could. As we hear God’s voice saying unto us, “Thou art my servant,” we can answer with David, “I am thy servant; thou hast loosed my bonds.” But the Lord calls us not only his <i>servants</i>, but his <i>chosen</i> ones—“I have chosen thee.” We have not chosen him first, but he hath chosen us. If we be God’s servants, we were not always so; to sovereign grace the change must 
be ascribed. The eye of sovereignty singled us out, and the voice 
of unchanging grace declared, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.” Long ere time began or space was created God had written upon his 
heart the names of his elect people, had predestinated them to be 
conformed unto the image of his Son, and ordained them heirs of all 
the fulness of his love, his grace, and his glory. What comfort is 
here! Has the Lord loved us so long, and will he yet cast us away? 
He knew how stiffnecked we should be; he understood that our hearts 
were evil, and yet he made the choice. Ah! our Saviour is no fickle 
lover. He doth not feel enchanted for awhile with some gleams of beauty 
from his church’s eye, and then afterwards cast her off because of her unfaithfulness. 
Nay, he married her in old eternity; and it is written of Jehovah, 
“He hateth putting away.” The eternal choice is a bond upon <i>our</i> gratitude and upon <i>his</i> faithfulness which neither can disown.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0518am-p3">All the attributes of Christ, as God and man, are at our disposal. 
All the fulness of the Godhead, whatever that marvellous term may 
comprehend, is ours to make us complete. He cannot endow us with the 
attributes of Deity; but he has done all that can be done, for he 
has made even his divine power and Godhead subservient to our salvation. 
His omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability and infallibility, 
are all combined for our defence. Arise, believer, and behold the 
Lord Jesus yoking the whole of his divine Godhead to the chariot of 
salvation! How vast his grace, how firm his faithfulness, how unswerving 
his immutability, how infinite his power, how limitless his knowledge! 
All these are by the Lord Jesus made the pillars of the temple of 
salvation; and all, without diminution of their infinity, are covenanted 
to us as our perpetual inheritance. The fathomless love of the Saviour’s heart is every drop of it ours; every sinew in the arm of might, 
every jewel in the crown of majesty, the immensity of divine knowledge, 
and the sternness of divine justice, all are ours, and shall be employed 
for us. The whole of Christ, in his adorable character as the Son 
of God, is by himself made over to us most richly to enjoy. His wisdom 
is our direction, his knowledge our instruction, his power our protection, 
his justice our surety, his love our comfort, his mercy our solace, 
and his immutability our trust. He makes no reserve, but opens the 
recesses of the Mount of God and bids us dig in its mines for the 
hidden treasures. “All, all, all are yours,” saith he, “be ye satisfied with favour and full of the goodness of the Lord.” Oh! how sweet thus to behold Jesus, and to call upon him with the 
certain confidence that in seeking the interposition of his love or 
power, we are but asking for that which he has already faithfully 
promised.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0518pm-p3">How happy are tried Christians, <i>afterwards</i>. No calm more deep than that which succeeds a storm. Who has not 
rejoiced in clear shinings after rain? Victorious banquets are for 
well-exercised soldiers. After killing the lion we eat the honey; 
after climbing the Hill Difficulty, we sit down in the arbour to rest; 
after traversing the Valley of Humiliation, after fighting with Apollyon, 
the shining one appears, with the healing branch from the tree of 
life. Our sorrows, like the passing keels of the vessels upon the 
sea, leave a silver line of holy light behind them “afterwards.” It is peace, sweet, deep peace, which follows the horrible turmoil 
which once reigned in our tormented, guilty souls. See, then, the 
happy estate of a Christian! He has his best things last, and he therefore 
in this world receives his worst things first. But even his worst 
things are “afterward” good things, harsh ploughings yielding joyful harvests. Even now 
he grows rich by his losses, he rises by his falls, he lives by dying, 
and becomes full by being emptied; if, then, his grievous afflictions 
yield him so much peaceable fruit in this life, what shall be the 
full vintage of joy “afterwards” in heaven? If his dark nights are as bright as the world’s days, what shall his days be? If even his starlight is more splendid 
than the sun, what must his sunlight be? If he can sing in a dungeon, 
how sweetly will he sing in heaven! If he can praise the Lord in the 
fires, how will he extol him before the eternal throne! If evil be 
good to him <i>now</i>, what will the overflowing goodness of God be to him <i>then</i>? Oh, blessed “afterward!” Who would not be a Christian? Who would not bear the present cross 
for the crown which cometh afterwards? But herein is work for patience, 
for the rest is not for today, nor the triumph for the present, but 
“afterward.” Wait, O soul, and let patience have her perfect work.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0519am-p3">Upstarts frequently usurp the highest places, while the truly great 
pine in obscurity. This is a riddle in providence whose solution will 
one day gladden the hearts of the upright; but it is so common a fact, 
that none of us should murmur if it should fall to our own lot. When 
our Lord was upon earth, although he is the Prince of the kings of 
the earth, yet he walked the footpath of weariness and service as 
the Servant of servants: what wonder is it if his followers, who are 
princes of the blood, should also be looked down upon as inferior 
and contemptible persons? The world is upside down, and therefore, 
the first are last and the last first. See how the servile sons of 
Satan lord it in the earth! What a high horse they ride! How they 
lift up their horn on high! Haman is in the court, while Mordecai 
sits in the gate; David wanders on the mountains, while Saul reigns 
in state; Elijah is complaining in the cave while Jezebel is boasting 
in the palace; yet who would wish to take the places of the proud 
rebels? and who, on the other hand, might not envy the despised saints? 
When the wheel turns, those who are lowest rise, and the highest sink. 
Patience, then, believer, eternity will right the wrongs of time.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0519am-p4">Let us not fall into the error of letting our passions and carnal 
appetites ride in triumph, while our nobler powers walk in the dust. 
Grace must reign as a prince, and make the members of the body instruments 
of righteousness. The Holy Spirit loves order, and he therefore sets 
our powers and faculties in due rank and place, giving the highest 
room to those spiritual faculties which link us with the great King; 
let us not disturb the divine arrangement, but ask for grace that 
we may keep under our body and bring it into subjection. We were not 
new created to allow our passions to rule over us, but that we, as 
kings, may reign in Christ Jesus over the triple kingdom of spirit, 
soul, and body, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0519pm-p3">It was a remarkable thing that the man who was never to die, for whom 
God had ordained an infinitely better lot, the man who should be carried 
to heaven in a chariot of fire, and be translated, that he should 
not see death—should thus pray, “Let me die, I am no better than my fathers.” We have here a memorable proof that God does not always answer prayer 
in kind, though he always does in effect. He gave Elias something 
better than that which he asked for, and thus really heard and answered 
him. Strange was it that the lion-hearted Elijah should be so depressed 
by Jezebel’s threat as to ask to die, and blessedly kind was it on the part of 
our heavenly Father that he did not take his desponding servant at 
his word. There is a limit to the doctrine of the prayer of faith. 
We are not to expect that God will give us everything we choose to 
ask for. We know that we sometimes ask, and do not receive, because 
we ask amiss. If we ask for that which is not promised—if we run counter to the spirit which the Lord would have us cultivate—if we ask contrary to his will, or to the decrees of his providence—if we ask merely for the gratification of our own ease, and without 
an eye to his glory, we must not expect that we shall receive. Yet, 
when we ask in faith, nothing doubting, if we receive not the precise 
thing asked for, we shall receive an equivalent, and more than an 
equivalent, for it. As one remarks, “If the Lord does not pay in silver, he will in gold; and if he does 
not pay in gold, he will in diamonds.” If he does not give you precisely what you ask for, he will give 
you that which is tantamount to it, and that which you will greatly 
rejoice to receive in lieu thereof. Be then, dear reader, much in 
prayer, and make this evening a season of earnest intercession, but 
take heed what you ask.</p>

His favours are always performed with the love of his heart. He does 
not send to us the cold meat and the broken pieces from the table 
of his luxury, but he dips our morsel in his own dish, and seasons 
our provisions with the spices of his fragrant affections. When he 
puts the golden tokens of his grace into our palms, he accompanies 
the gift with such a warm pressure of our hand, that the manner of 
his giving is as precious as the boon itself. He will come into our 
houses upon his errands of kindness, and he will not act as some austere 
visitors do in the poor man’s cottage, but he sits by our side, not despising our poverty, nor 
blaming our weakness. Beloved, with what smiles does he speak! What 
golden sentences drop from his gracious lips! What embraces of affection 
does he bestow upon us! If he had but given us farthings, the way 
of his giving would have gilded them; but as it is, the costly alms 
are set in a golden basket by his pleasant carriage. It is impossible 
to doubt the sincerity of his charity, for there is a bleeding heart 
stamped upon the face of all his benefactions. He giveth liberally 
and upbraideth not. Not one hint that we are burdensome to him; not 
one cold look for his poor pensioners; but he rejoices in his mercy, 
and presses us to his bosom while he is pouring out his life for us. 
There is a fragrance in his spikenard which nothing but his heart 
could produce; there is a sweetness in his honey-comb which could 
not be in it unless the very essence of his soul’s affection had been mingled with it. Oh! the rare communion which 
such singular heartiness effecteth! May we continually taste and know 
the blessedness of it!</p>

Martha, we cumber ourselves with much serving. Our meagre faith brings 
leanness into our souls; we do not open our mouths wide, though God 
has promised to fill them. Does he not this evening draw us to trust 
him? Can we not hear him say, “Come, my child, and trust me. The veil is rent; enter into my presence, 
and approach boldly to the throne of my grace. I am worthy of thy 
fullest confidence, cast thy cares on me. Shake thyself from the dust 
of thy cares, and put on thy beautiful garments of joy.” But, alas! though called with tones of love to the blessed exercise 
of this comforting grace, we will not come. At another time <i>he draws us to closer communion with</i> <i>himself</i>. We have been sitting on the doorstep of God’s house, and he bids us advance into the banqueting hall and sup with 
him, but we decline the honour. There are secret rooms not yet opened 
to us; Jesus invites us to enter them, but we hold back. Shame on 
our cold hearts! We are but poor lovers of our sweet Lord Jesus, not 
fit to be his servants, much less to be his brides, and yet he hath 
exalted us to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, married 
to him by a glorious marriage-covenant. Herein is love! But it is 
love which <i>takes</i> <i>no denial</i>. If we obey not the gentle drawings of his love, he will send affliction 
to drive us into closer intimacy with himself. Have us nearer he will. 
What foolish children we are to refuse those bands of love, and so 
bring upon our backs that scourge of small cords, which Jesus knows

<p class="normal" id="d0521am-p4">But while this should be a matter of earnest and prayerful inquiry, 
no one ought to be content whilst there is any such thing as an “if” about his having tasted that the Lord is gracious. A jealous and 
holy distrust of self may give rise to the question even in the believer’s heart, but the <i>continuance</i> of such a doubt would be an evil indeed. We must not rest without 
a desperate struggle to clasp the Saviour in the arms of faith, and 
say, “I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to 
keep that which I have committed unto him.” Do not rest, O believer, till thou hast a full assurance of thine 
interest in Jesus. Let nothing satisfy thee till, by the infallible 
witness of the Holy Spirit bearing witness with thy spirit, thou art 
certified that thou art a child of God. Oh, trifle not here; let no 
“perhaps” and “peradventure” and “if” and “maybe” satisfy thy soul. Build on eternal verities, and verily build upon 
them. Get the sure mercies of David, and surely get them. Let thine 
anchor be cast into that which is within the veil, and see to it that 
thy soul be linked to the anchor by a cable that will not break. Advance 
beyond these dreary “ifs;” abide no more in the wilderness of doubts and fears; cross the Jordan 
of distrust, and enter the Canaan of peace, where the Canaanite still 
lingers, but where the land ceaseth not to flow with milk and honey.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0521pm-p3">Famine pinched all the nations, and it seemed inevitable that Jacob 
and his family should suffer great want; but the God of providence, 
who never forgets the objects of electing love, had stored a granary 
for his people by giving the Egyptians warning of the scarcity, and 
leading them to treasure up the grain of the years of plenty. Little 
did Jacob expect deliverance from Egypt, but there was the corn in 
store for him. Believer, though all things are apparently against 
thee, rest assured that God has made a reservation on thy behalf; 
in the roll of thy griefs there is a saving clause. Somehow he will 
deliver thee, and somewhere he will provide for thee. The quarter 
from which thy rescue shall arise may be a very unexpected one, but 
help will assuredly come in thine extremity, and thou shalt magnify 
the name of the Lord. If men do not feed thee, ravens shall; and if 
earth yield not wheat, heaven shall drop with manna. Therefore be 
of good courage, and rest quietly in the Lord. God can make the sun 
rise in the west if he pleases, and make the source of distress the 
channel of delight. The corn in Egypt was all in the hands of the 
beloved Joseph; he opened or closed the granaries at will. And so 
the riches of providence are all in the absolute power of our Lord 
Jesus, who will dispense them liberally to his people. Joseph was 
abundantly ready to succour his own family; and Jesus is unceasing 
in his faithful care for his brethren. Our business is to go after 
the help which is provided for us: we must not sit still in despondency, 
but bestir ourselves. Prayer will bear us soon into the presence of 
our royal Brother: once before his throne we have only to ask and 
have: his stores are not exhausted; there is corn still: his heart 
is not hard, he will give the corn to us. Lord, forgive our unbelief, 
and this evening constrain us to draw largely from thy fulness and 
receive grace for grace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0522am-p3">Changeful experience often leads the anxious believer to inquire “Why is it thus with me?” I looked for light, but lo, darkness came; for peace, but behold, 
trouble. I said in my heart, my mountain standeth firm; I shall never 
be moved. Lord, thou dost hide thy face, and I am troubled. It was 
but yesterday that I could read my title clear; today my evidences 
are bedimmed, and my hopes are clouded. Yesterday, I could climb to 
Pisgah’s top, and view the landscape o'er, and rejoice with confidence in 
my future inheritance; today, my spirit has no hopes, but many fears; 
no joys, but much distress. Is this part of God’s plan with me? Can this be the way in which God would bring me to 
heaven? Yes, it is even so. The eclipse of your faith, the darkness 
of your mind, the fainting of your hope, all these things are but 
parts of God’s method of making you ripe for the great inheritance upon which you 
shall soon enter. These trials are for the testing and strengthening 
of your faith—they are waves that wash you further upon the rock—they are winds which waft your ship the more swiftly towards the desired 
haven. According to David’s words, so it might be said of you, “So he bringeth them to their desired haven.” By honour and dishonour, by evil report and by good report, by plenty 
and by poverty, by joy and by distress, by persecution and by peace, 
by all these things is the life of your souls maintained, and by each 
of these are you helped on your way. Oh, think not, believer, that 
your sorrows are out of God’s plan; they are necessary parts of it. “We must, through much tribulation, enter the kingdom.” Learn, then, even to “count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0522pm-p3">From every point our Well-beloved is most fair. Our various experiences 
are meant by our heavenly Father to furnish fresh standpoints from 
which we may view the loveliness of Jesus; how amiable are our trials 
when they carry us aloft where we may gain clearer views of Jesus 
than ordinary life could afford us! We have seen him from the top 
of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, and he has shone upon 
us as the sun in his strength; but we have seen him also “from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards,” and he has lost none of his loveliness. From the languishing of a 
sick bed, from the borders of the grave, have we turned our eyes to 
our soul’s spouse, and he has never been otherwise than “all fair.” Many of his saints have looked upon him from the gloom of dungeons, 
and from the red flames of the stake, yet have they never uttered 
an ill word of him, but have died extolling his surpassing charms. 
Oh, noble and pleasant employment to be forever gazing at our sweet 
Lord Jesus! Is it not unspeakably delightful to view the Saviour in 
all his offices, and to perceive him matchless in each?—to shift the kaleidoscope, as it were, and to find fresh combinations 
of peerless graces? In the manger and in eternity, on the cross and 
on his throne, in the garden and in his kingdom, among thieves or 
in the midst of cherubim, he is everywhere “altogether lovely.” Examine carefully every little act of his life, and every trait of 
his character, and he is as lovely in the minute as in the majestic. 
Judge him as you will, you cannot censure; weigh him as you please, 
and he will not be found wanting. Eternity shall not discover the 
shadow of a spot in our Beloved, but rather, as ages revolve, his 
hidden glories shall shine forth with yet more inconceivable splendour, 
and his unutterable loveliness shall more and more ravish all celestial 
minds.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0523am-p3">Most manifestly the confidence which the Psalmist here expressed was 
a <i>divine confidence</i>. He did not say, “<i>I</i> have grace enough to perfect that which concerneth me—my faith is so steady that it will not stagger—my love is so warm that it will never grow cold—my resolution is so firm that nothing can move it”; no, his dependence was on the Lord alone. If we indulge in any confidence 
which is not grounded on the Rock of Ages, our confidence is worse 
than a dream, it will fall upon us, and cover us with its ruins, to 
our sorrow and confusion. All that Nature spins time will unravel, 
to the eternal confusion of all who are clothed therein. The Psalmist 
was wise, he rested upon nothing short of the <i>Lord's</i> work. It is the Lord who has begun the good work within us; it is 
he who has carried it on; and if he does not finish it, it never will 
be complete. If there be one stitch in the celestial garment of our 
righteousness which we are to insert ourselves, then we are lost; 
but this is our confidence, the Lord who began will perfect. He <i>has</i> done it all, <i>must</i> do it all, and <i>will</i> do it all. Our confidence must not be in what we have done, nor in 
what we have resolved to do, but entirely in what <i>the Lord</i> will do. Unbelief insinuates—“You will never be able to stand. Look at the evil of your heart, you 
can never conquer sin; remember the sinful pleasures and temptations 
of the world that beset you, you will be certainly allured by them 
and led astray.” Ah! yes, we should indeed perish if left to our own strength. If 
we had alone to navigate our frail vessels over so rough a sea, we 
might well give up the voyage in despair; but, thanks be to God, he 
will perfect that which concerneth us, and bring us to the desired 
haven. We can never be too confident when we confide in him alone, 
and never too much concerned to <i>have such</i> a trust.</p>

to be burned upon the altar of God: but Israel, in the time of her 
backsliding, became ungenerous, and made but few votive offerings 
to her Lord: this was an evidence of coldness of heart towards God 
and his house. Reader, does this never occur with you? Might not the 
complaint of the text be occasionally, if not frequently, brought 
against you? Those who are poor in pocket, if rich in faith, will 
be accepted none the less because their gifts are small; but, poor 
reader, do you give in fair proportion to the Lord, or is the widow’s mite kept back from the sacred treasury? The rich believer should 
be thankful for the talent entrusted to him, but should not forget 
his large responsibility, for where much is given much will be required; 
but, rich reader, are you mindful of your obligations, and rendering 
to the Lord according to the benefit received? Jesus gave his blood 
for us, what shall we give to him? We are his, and all that we have, 
for he has purchased us unto himself—can we act as if we were our own? O for more consecration! and to 
this end, O for more love! Blessed Jesus, how good it is of thee to accept our sweet cane 
bought with money! nothing is too costly as a tribute to thine unrivalled 
love, and yet thou dost receive with favour the smallest sincere token 
of affection! Thou dost receive our poor forget-me-nots and love-tokens 
as though they were intrinsically precious, though indeed they are 
but as the bunch of wild flowers which the child brings to its mother. 
Never may we grow niggardly towards thee, and from this hour never 
may we hear thee complain of us again for withholding the gifts of 
our love. We will give thee the first fruits of our increase, and 
pay thee tithes of all, and then we will confess “of thine own have we given thee.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0524am-p3">In looking back upon the character of our prayers, if we do it honestly, 
we shall be filled with wonder that God has ever answered them. There 
may be some who think their prayers worthy of acceptance—as the Pharisee did; but the true Christian, in a more enlightened 
retrospect, weeps over his prayers, and if he could retrace his steps 
he would desire to pray more earnestly. Remember, Christian, how <i>cold</i> thy prayers have been. When in thy closet thou shouldst have wrestled 
as Jacob did; but instead thereof, thy petitions have been faint and 
few—far removed from that humble, believing, persevering faith, which 
cries, “I will not let thee go except thou bless me.” Yet, wonderful to say, God has heard these cold prayers of thine, 
and not only heard, but answered them. Reflect also, how <i>infrequent</i> have been thy prayers, unless thou hast been in trouble, and <i>then</i> thou hast gone often to the mercy-seat: but when deliverance has 
come, where has been thy constant supplication? Yet, notwithstanding 
thou hast ceased to pray as once thou didst, God has not ceased to 
bless. When thou hast neglected the mercy-seat, God has not deserted 
it, but the bright light of the Shekinah has always been visible between 
the wings of the cherubim. Oh! it is marvellous that the Lord should 
regard those intermittent spasms of importunity which come and go 
with our necessities. What a God is he thus to hear the prayers of 
those who come to him when they have pressing wants, but neglect him 
when they have received a mercy; who approach him when they are forced 
to come, but who almost forget to address him when mercies are plentiful 
and sorrows are few. Let his gracious kindness in hearing such prayers 
touch our hearts, so that we may henceforth be found “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0524pm-p3">The word “conversation” does not merely mean our talk and converse with one another, but 
the whole course of our life and behaviour in the world. The Greek 
word signifies the actions and the privileges of citizenship: and 
thus we are commanded to let our actions, as citizens of the New Jerusalem, 
be such as becometh the gospel of Christ. What sort of conversation 
is this? In the first place, <i>the gospel is very simple</i>. So Christians should be simple and plain in their habits. There 
should be about our manner, our speech, our dress, our whole behaviour, 
that simplicity which is the very soul of beauty. The gospel is <i>pre-eminently true</i>, it is gold without dross; and the Christian’s life will be lustreless and valueless without the jewel of truth. 
The gospel is a very <i>fearless gospel</i>, it boldly proclaims the truth, whether men like it or not: we must 
be equally faithful and unflinching. But the gospel is also <i>very gentle</i>. Mark this spirit in its Founder: “a bruised reed he will not break.” Some professors are sharper than a thorn-hedge; such men are not 
like Jesus. Let us seek to win others by the gentleness of our words 
and acts. The gospel is <i>very loving</i>. It is the message of the God of love to a lost and fallen race. 
Christ’s last command to his disciples was, “Love one another.” O for more real, hearty union and love to all the saints; for more 
tender compassion towards the souls of the worst and vilest of men! 
We must not forget that the gospel of Christ is <i>holy</i>. It never excuses sin: it pardons it, but only through an atonement. 
If our life is to resemble the gospel, we must shun, not merely the 
grosser vices, but everything that would hinder our perfect conformity 
to Christ. For his sake, for our own sakes, and for the sakes of others, 
we must strive day by day to let our conversation be more in accordance 
with his gospel.</p>

lest I murmur against thee. Forsake me not in the day of my repentance, 
lest I lose the hope of pardon, and fall into despair; and forsake 
me not in the day of my strongest faith, lest faith degenerate into 
presumption. Forsake me not, for without thee I am weak, but with 
thee I am strong. Forsake me not, for my path is dangerous, and full

not her brood; do thou then evermore cover me with thy feathers, and

of joyful news before they could tell their own tale. These early 
Christians were all on fire to speak of Christ’s resurrection, and to proclaim what they knew of the Lord; they made 
common property of their experiences. This evening let their example 
impress us deeply. We too must bear our witness concerning Jesus. 
John’s account of the sepulchre needed to be supplemented by Peter; and 
Mary could speak of something further still; combined, we have a full 
testimony from which nothing can be spared. We have each of us peculiar 
gifts and special manifestations; but the one object God has in view 
is the perfecting of the whole body of Christ. We must, therefore, 
bring our spiritual possessions and lay them at the apostle’s feet, and make distribution unto all of what God has given to us. 
Keep back no part of the precious truth, but speak what you know, 
and testify what you have seen. Let not the toil or darkness, or possible 
unbelief of your friends, weigh one moment in the scale. Up, and be 
marching to the place of duty, and there tell what great things God 
has shown to your soul.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0526am-p3">Care, even though exercised upon legitimate objects, if carried to 
excess, has in it the nature of sin. The precept to avoid anxious 
care is earnestly inculcated by our Saviour, again and again; it is 
reiterated by the apostles; and it is one which cannot be neglected 
without involving transgression: for the very essence of anxious care 
is the imagining that we are wiser than God, and the thrusting ourselves 
into his place to do for him that which he has undertaken to do for 
us. We attempt to think of that which we fancy he will forget; we 
labour to take upon ourselves our weary burden, as if he were unable 
or unwilling to take it for us. Now this disobedience to his plain 
precept, this unbelief in his Word, this presumption in intruding 
upon his province, is all sinful. Yet more than this, anxious care 
often leads to acts of sin. He who cannot calmly leave his affairs 
in God’s hand, but will carry his own burden, is very likely to be tempted 
to use wrong means to help himself. This sin leads to a forsaking 
of God as our counsellor, and resorting instead to human wisdom. This 
is going to the “broken cistern” instead of to the “fountain;” a sin which was laid against Israel of old. Anxiety makes us doubt 
God’s lovingkindness, and thus our love to him grows cold; we feel mistrust, 
and thus grieve the Spirit of God, so that our prayers become hindered, 
our consistent example marred, and our life one of self-seeking. Thus 
want of confidence in God leads us to wander far from him; but if 
through simple faith in his promise, we cast each burden as it comes 
upon him, and are “careful for nothing” because he undertakes to care for us, it will keep us close to him, 
and strengthen us against much temptation. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, 
because he trusteth in thee.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0526pm-p3">Perseverance is the badge of true saints. The Christian life is not 
a <i>beginning</i> only in the ways of God, but also a <i>continuance</i> in the same as long as life lasts. It is with a Christian as it was 
with the great Napoleon: he said, “Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest must maintain me.” So, under God, dear brother in the Lord, conquest has made you what 
you are, and conquest must sustain you. Your motto must be, “Excelsior.” He only is a true conqueror, and shall be crowned at the last, who 
continueth till war’s trumpet is blown no more. Perseverance is, therefore, the target 
of all our spiritual enemies. The <i>world</i> does not object to your being a Christian for a time, if she can 
but tempt you to cease your pilgrimage, and settle down to buy and 
sell with her in Vanity Fair. The <i>flesh</i> will seek to ensnare you, and to prevent your pressing on to glory. 
“It is weary work being a pilgrim; come, give it up. Am I always to 
be mortified? Am I never to be indulged? Give me at least a furlough 
from this constant warfare.” <i>Satan</i> will make many a fierce attack on your perseverance; it will be the 
mark for all his arrows. He will strive to hinder you <i>in</i> <i>service</i>: he will insinuate that you are doing no good; and that you want 
rest. He will endeavour to make you weary of <i>suffering</i>, he will whisper, “Curse God, and die.” Or he will attack your <i>steadfastness</i>: “What is the good of being so zealous? Be quiet like the rest; sleep 
as do others, and let your lamp go out as the other virgins do.” Or he will assail your <i>doctrinal sentiments</i>: “Why do you hold to these denominational creeds? Sensible men are getting 
more liberal; they are removing the old landmarks: fall in with the 
times.” Wear your shield, Christian, therefore, close upon your armour, and 
cry mightily unto God, that by his Spirit you may endure to the end.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0527am-p3">Mephibosheth was no great ornament to a royal table, yet he had a 
continual place at David’s board, because the king could see in his face the features of the 
beloved Jonathan. Like Mephibosheth, we may cry unto the King of Glory, 
“What is thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog 
as I am?” but still the Lord indulges us with most familiar intercourse with 
himself, because he sees in our countenances the remembrance of his 
dearly-beloved Jesus. The Lord’s people are <i>dear for another’s sake</i>. Such is the love which the Father bears to his only begotten, that 
for his sake he raises his lowly brethren from poverty and banishment, 
to courtly companionship, noble rank, and royal provision. Their <i>deformity shall not rob them of their privileges</i>. Lameness is no bar to sonship; the cripple is as much the heir as 
if he could run like Asahel. Our right does not limp, though our might 
may. A king’s table is a noble hiding-place for lame legs, and at the gospel feast 
we learn to glory in infirmities, because the power of Christ resteth 
upon us. Yet grievous <i>disability</i> <i>may mar the persons of the best-loved saints</i>. Here is one feasted by David, and yet so lame in both his feet that 
he could not go up with the king when he fled from the city, and was 
therefore maligned and injured by his servant Ziba. Saints whose faith 
is weak, and whose knowledge is slender, are great losers; they are 
exposed to many enemies, and cannot follow the king whithersoever 
he goeth. This <i>disease frequently arises from</i> <i>falls</i>. Bad nursing in their spiritual infancy often causes converts to 
fall into a despondency from which they never recover, and sin in 
other cases brings broken bones. Lord, help the lame to leap like 
an hart, and satisfy all thy people with the bread of thy table!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0527pm-p3">If Mephibosheth was thus humbled by David’s kindness, what shall <i>we</i> be in the presence of our gracious Lord? The more grace we have, 
the less we shall think of ourselves, for grace, like light, reveals 
our impurity. Eminent saints have scarcely known to what to compare 
themselves, their sense of unworthiness has been so clear and keen. 
“I am,” says holy Rutherford, “a dry and withered branch, a piece of dead carcass, dry bones, and 
not able to step over a straw.” In another place he writes, “Except as to open outbreakings, I want nothing of what Judas and Cain 
had.” The meanest objects in nature appear to the humbled mind to have 
a preference above itself, because they have never contracted sin: 
a dog may be greedy, fierce, or filthy, but it has no conscience to 
violate, no Holy Spirit to resist. A dog may be a worthless animal, 
and yet by a little kindness it is soon won to love its master, and 
is faithful unto death; but we forget the goodness of the Lord, and 
follow not at his call. The term “dead dog” is the most expressive of all terms of contempt, but it is none too 
strong to express the self- abhorrence of instructed believers. They 
do not affect mock modesty, they mean what they say, they have weighed 
themselves in the balances of the sanctuary, and found out the vanity 
of their nature. At best, we are but clay, animated dust, mere walking 
hillocks; but viewed as sinners, we are monsters indeed. Let it be 
published in heaven as a wonder, that the Lord Jesus should set his 
heart’s love upon such as we are. Dust and ashes though we be, we must and 
will “magnify the exceeding greatness of his grace.” Could not his heart find rest in heaven? Must he needs come to these 
tents of Kedar for a spouse, and choose a bride upon whom the sun 
had looked? O heavens and earth, break forth into a song, and give 
all glory to our sweet Lord Jesus.</p>

bear thee to the glorified. The everlasting song is almost on thy 
lip. The portals of heaven stand open for thee. Think not that thou 
canst fail of entering into rest. If he hath called thee, nothing 
can divide thee from his love. Distress cannot sever the bond; the 
fire of persecution cannot burn the link; the hammer of hell cannot 
break the chain. Thou art secure; that voice which called thee at 
first, shall call thee yet again from earth to heaven, from death’s dark gloom to immortality’s unuttered splendours. Rest assured, the heart of him who has justified 
thee beats with infinite love towards thee. Thou shalt soon be with 
the glorified, where thy portion is; thou art only waiting here to 
be made meet for the inheritance, and that done, the wings of angels 
shall waft thee far away, to the mount of peace, and joy, and blessedness,

<p class="normal" id="d0528pm-p3">Memory is frequently the bond slave of despondency. Dispairing minds 
call to remembrance every dark foreboding in the past, and dilate 
upon every gloomy feature in the present; thus memory, clothed in 
sackcloth, presents to the mind a cup of mingled gall and wormwood. 
There is, however, no necessity for this. Wisdom can readily transform 
memory into an angel of comfort. That same recollection which in its 
left hand brings so many gloomy omens, may be trained to bear in its 
right a wealth of hopeful signs. She need not wear a crown of iron, 
she may encircle her brow with a fillet of gold, all spangled with 
stars. Thus it was in Jeremiah’s experience: in the previous verse memory had brought him to deep 
humiliation of soul: “My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me;” and now this same memory restored him to life and comfort. “This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.” Like a two-edged sword, his memory first killed his pride with one 
edge, and then slew his despair with the other. As a general principle, 
if we would exercise our memories more wisely, we might, in our very 
darkest distress, strike a match which would instantaneously kindle 
the lamp of comfort. There is no need for God to create a new thing 
upon the earth in order to restore believers to joy; if they would 
prayerfully rake the ashes of the past, they would find light for 
the present; and if they would turn to the book of truth and the throne 
of grace, their candle would soon shine as aforetime. Be it ours to 
remember the lovingkindness of the Lord, and to rehearse his deeds 
of grace. Let us open the volume of recollection which is so richly 
illuminated with memorials of mercy, and we shall soon be happy. Thus 
memory may be, as Coleridge calls it, “the bosom-spring of joy,” and when the Divine Comforter bends it to his service, it may be 
chief among earthly comforters.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0529am-p3">“Be ye angry, and sin not.” There can hardly be goodness in a man if he be not angry at sin; 
he who loves truth must hate every false way. How our Lord Jesus hated 
it when the temptation came! Thrice it assailed him in different forms, 
but ever he met it with, “Get thee behind me, Satan.” He hated it in others; none the less fervently because he showed 
his hate oftener in tears of pity than in words of rebuke; yet what 
language could be more stern, more Elijah-like, than the words, “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer.” He hated wickedness, so much that he bled to wound it to the heart; 
he died that it might die; he was buried that he might bury it in 
his tomb; and he rose that he might forever trample it beneath his 
feet. Christ is in the Gospel, and that Gospel is opposed to wickedness 
in every shape. Wickedness arrays itself in fair garments, and imitates 
the language of holiness; but the precepts of Jesus, like his famous 
scourge of small cords, chase it out of the temple, and will not tolerate 
it in the Church. So, too, in the heart where Jesus reigns, what war 
there is between Christ and Belial! And when our Redeemer shall come 
to be our Judge, those thundering words, “Depart, ye cursed” which are, indeed, but a prolongation of his life-teaching concerning 
sin, shall manifest his abhorrence of iniquity. As warm as is his 
love to sinners, so hot is his hatred of sin; as perfect as is his 
righteousness, so complete shall be the destruction of every form 
of wickedness. O thou glorious champion of right, and destroyer of 
wrong, for this cause hath God, even thy God, anointed thee with the

the perseverance of their efforts, and the blast of their gospel trumpets; 
and now there are some who would rebuild that accursed system upon 
its old foundation. O Lord, be pleased to thwart their unrighteous 
endeavours, and pull down every stone which they build. It should 
be a serious business with us to be thoroughly purged of every error 
which may have a tendency to foster the spirit of Popery, and when 
we have made a clean sweep at home we should seek in every way to 
oppose its all too rapid spread abroad in the church and in the world. 
This last can be done in secret by fervent prayer, and in public by 
decided testimony. We must warn with judicious boldness those who 
are inclined towards the errors of Rome; we must instruct the young 
in gospel truth, and tell them of the black doings of Popery in the 
olden times. We must aid in spreading the light more thoroughly through 
the land, for priests, like owls, hate daylight. Are we doing all 
we can for Jesus and the gospel? If not, our negligence plays into

<p class="normal" id="d0530am-p3">A little thorn may cause much suffering. A little cloud may hide the 
sun. Little foxes spoil the vines; and little sins do mischief to 
the tender heart. These little sins burrow in the soul, and make it 
so full of that which is hateful to Christ, that he will hold no comfortable 
fellowship and communion with us. A great sin cannot destroy a Christian, 
but a little sin can make him miserable. Jesus will not walk with 
his people unless they drive out every known sin. He says, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have 
kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.” Some Christians very seldom enjoy their Saviour’s presence. How is this? Surely it must be an affliction for a tender 
child to be separated from his father. Art thou a child of God, and 
yet satisfied to go on without seeing thy Father’s face? What! thou the spouse of Christ, and yet content without his 
company! Surely, thou hast fallen into a sad state, for the chaste 
spouse of Christ mourns like a dove without her mate, when he has 
left her. Ask, then, the question, what has driven Christ from thee? 
He hides his face behind the wall of thy sins. That wall may be built 
up of <i>little</i> pebbles, as easily as of great stones. The sea is made of drops; 
the rocks are made of grains: and the sea which divides thee from 
Christ may be filled with the drops of thy little sins; and the rock 
which has well nigh wrecked thy barque, may have been made by the 
daily working of the coral insects of thy little sins. If thou wouldst 
live with Christ, and walk with Christ, and see Christ, and have fellowship 
with Christ, take heed of “the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.” Jesus invites you to go <i>with</i> <i>him</i> and take them. He will surely, like Samson, take the foxes at once 
and easily. Go with him to the hunting.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0530pm-p3">Christian, what hast thou to do with sin? <i>Hath it not cost</i> <i>thee enough already</i>? Burnt child, wilt thou play with the fire? What! when thou hast 
already been between the jaws of the lion, wilt thou step a second 
time into his den? Hast thou not had enough of the old serpent? Did 
he not poison all thy veins once, and wilt thou play upon the hole 
of the asp, and put thy hand upon the cockatrice’s den a second time? Oh, be not so mad! so foolish! Did sin ever yield 
thee real pleasure? Didst thou find solid satisfaction in it? If so, 
go back to thine old drudgery, and wear the chain again, if it delight 
thee. But inasmuch as sin did never give thee what it promised to 
bestow, but deluded thee with lies, be not a second time snared by 
the old fowler—be free, and let the remembrance of thy ancient bondage forbid thee 
to enter the net again! <i>It is contrary to</i> <i>the designs of eternal love</i>, which all have an eye to thy purity and holiness; therefore run 
not counter to the purposes of thy Lord. Another thought should restrain 
thee from sin. <i>Christians can never sin cheaply</i>; they pay a heavy price for iniquity. Transgression destroys peace 
of mind, obscures fellowship with Jesus, hinders prayer, brings darkness 
over the soul; therefore be not the serf and bondman of sin. There 
is yet a higher argument: each time you “serve sin” you have “<i>Crucified the Lord afresh, and put him to an open shame</i>.” Can you bear that thought? Oh! if you have fallen into any special 
sin during this day, it may be my Master has sent this admonition 
this evening, to bring you back before you have backslidden very far. 
Turn thee to Jesus anew; he has not forgotten his love to thee; his 
grace is still the same. With weeping and repentance, come thou to 
his footstool, and thou shalt be once more received into his heart; 
thou shalt be set upon a rock again, and thy goings shall be established.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0531am-p3">David passed that gloomy brook when flying with his mourning company 
from his traitor son. The man after God’s own heart was not exempt from trouble, nay, his life was full of 
it. He was both the Lord’s Anointed, and the Lord’s Afflicted. Why then should we expect to escape? At sorrow’s gates the noblest of our race have waited with ashes on their heads; 
wherefore then should we complain as though some strange thing had 
happened unto us?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0531am-p4">The <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0531am-p4.1">King</span>  of kings himself was not favoured with a more cheerful or royal 
road. He passed over the filthy ditch of Kidron, through which the 
filth of Jerusalem flowed. God had one Son without sin, but not a 
single child without the rod. It is a great joy to believe that Jesus 
has been tempted in all points like as we are. What is our Kidron 
this morning? Is it a faithless friend, a sad bereavement, a slanderous 
reproach, a dark foreboding? The King has passed over all these. Is 
it bodily pain, poverty, persecution, or contempt? Over each of these 
Kidrons the King has gone before us. “In all our afflictions he was afflicted.” The idea of strangeness in our trials must be banished at once and 
forever, for he who is the Head of all saints, knows by experience 
the grief which we think so peculiar. All the citizens of Zion must 
be free of the Honourable Company of Mourners, of which the Prince 
Immanuel is Head and Captain.</p>

of the wells of salvation, though now for a season we have to pass 
by the noxious streams of sin and sorrow. Courage, soldiers of the 
Cross, the King himself triumphed after going over Kidron, and so 
shall you.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0531pm-p3">Humbling as is the statement, yet the fact is certain, that we are 
all more or less suffering under the disease of sin. What a comfort 
to know that we have a great Physician who is both able and willing 
to heal us! Let us think of him awhile tonight. His cures are very 
<i>speedy</i>—there is life in a look at him; his cures are <i>radical</i>—he strikes at the centre of the disease; and hence, his cures are 
sure and certain. He never fails, and <i>the disease never returns</i>. There is no relapse where Christ heals; no fear that his patients 
should be merely patched up for a season, he makes new men of them: 
a new heart also does he give them, and a right spirit does he put 
within them. He is well skilled in <i>all</i> diseases. Physicians generally have some <i>speciality</i>. Although they may know a little about almost all our pains and ills, 
there is usually one disease which they have studied above all others; 
but Jesus Christ is thoroughly acquainted with the whole of human 
nature. He is as much at home with one sinner as with another, and 
never yet did he meet with an out-of-the-way case that was difficult 
to him. He has had extraordinary complications of strange diseases 
to deal with, but he has known exactly with one glance of his eye 
how to treat the patient. He is the only universal doctor; and the 
medicine he gives is the only true catholicon, healing in every instance. 
Whatever our spiritual malady may be, we should apply at once to this 
Divine Physician. There is no brokenness of heart which Jesus cannot 
bind up. “His blood cleanseth from all sin.” We have but to think of the myriads who have been delivered from 
all sorts of diseases through the power and virtue of his touch, and 
we shall joyfully put ourselves in his hands. We trust him, and sin 
dies; we love him, and grace lives; we wait for him and grace is strengthened; 
we see him as he is, and grace is perfected forever.</p>

realm of time in the first day? Then little wonder is it if I have 
also changes in my circumstances from the sunshine of prosperity to 
the midnight of adversity. It will not always be the blaze of noon 
even in my soul concerns, I must expect at seasons to mourn the absence 
of my former joys, and seek my Beloved in the night. Nor am I alone 
in this, for all the Lord’s beloved ones have had to sing the mingled song of judgment and of 
mercy, of trial and deliverance, of mourning and of delight. It is

of evening as it falls. There is beauty both in sunrise and sunset; 
sing of it, and glorify the Lord. Like the nightingale, pour forth 
thy notes at all hours. <i>Believe that the night is as useful as the day</i>. The dews of grace fall heavily in the night of sorrow. The stars 
of promise shine forth gloriously amid the darkness of grief. <i>Continue</i> <i>thy service</i> under all changes. If in the day thy watchword be <i>labour</i>, at night exchange it for <i>watch</i>. Every hour has its duty, do thou continue in thy calling as the 
Lord’s servant until he shall suddenly appear in his glory. My soul, thine 
evening of old age and death is drawing near; dread it not, for it 
is part of the day; and the Lord has said, “I will cover him all the day long.”</p>

eye, all around I am wearied with a vision of hot and arid sand, strewn 
with ten thousand bleaching skeletons of wretched men who have expired 
in anguish, having lost their way in the pitiless waste. What an appalling 
sight! How horrible! a sea of sand without a bound, and without an 
oasis, a cheerless graveyard for a race forlorn! But behold and wonder! 
Upon a sudden, upspringing from the scorching sand I see a plant of 
renown; and as it grows it buds, the bud expands—it is a rose, and at its side a lily bows its modest head; and, miracle 
of miracles! as the fragrance of those flowers is diffused the wilderness 
is transformed into a fruitful field, and all around it blossoms exceedingly, 
the glory of Lebanon is given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and 
Sharon. Call it not Sahara, call it Paradise. Speak not of it any 
longer as the valley of deathshade, for where the skeletons lay bleaching 
in the sun, behold a resurrection is proclaimed, and up spring the 
dead, a mighty army, full of life immortal. Jesus is that plant of 
renown, and his presence makes all things new. Nor is the wonder less 
in each individual’s salvation. Yonder I behold you, dear reader, cast out, an infant, 
unswathed, unwashed, defiled with your own blood, left to be food 
for beasts of prey. But lo, a jewel has been thrown into your bosom 
by a divine hand, and for its sake you have been pitied and tended 
by divine providence, you are washed and cleansed from your defilement, 
you are adopted into heaven’s family, the fair seal of love is upon your forehead, and the ring 
of faithfulness is on your hand—you are now a prince unto God, though once an orphan, cast away. O 
prize exceedingly the matchless power and grace which changes deserts 
into gardens, and makes the barren heart to sing for joy.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0602am-p3">In every believer’s heart there is a constant struggle
between the old nature and the new. The old nature is very
active, and loses no opportunity of plying all the weapons
of its deadly armoury against newborn grace; while on the
other hand, the new nature is ever on the watch to resist
and destroy its enemy. Grace within us will employ prayer,
and faith, and hope, and love, to cast out the evil; it
takes unto it the “whole armour of God,” and wrestles
earnestly. These two opposing natures will never cease to
struggle so long as we are in this world. The battle of
“Christian” with “Apollyon” lasted three hours, but the
battle of Christian with himself lasted all the way from
the Wicket Gate to the river Jordan. The enemy is so
securely entrenched within us that he can never be driven
out while we are in this body: but although we are closely
beset, and often in sore conflict, we have an Almighty
helper, even Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, who is
ever with us, and who assures us that we shall eventually
come off more than conquerors through Him. With such
assistance the new-born nature is more than a match for its
foes. Are you fighting with the adversary today? Are
Satan, the world, and the flesh, all against you? Be not
discouraged nor dismayed. Fight on! For God Himself is with
you; Jehovah Nissi is your banner, and Jehovah Rophi is the
healer of your wounds. Fear not, you shall overcome, for
who can defeat Omnipotence? Fight on, “looking unto Jesus;”
and though long and stern be the conflict, sweet will be
the victory, and glorious the promised reward. “From
strength to strength go on; Wrestle, and fight, and pray,
Tread all the powers of darkness down, And win the
well-fought day.”</p>

Lord, how much more fitly may I thus address him! He is indeed my 
Master in both senses, a ruling Master and a teaching Master. I delight 
to run upon his errands, and to sit at his feet. I am both his servant 
and his disciple, and count it my highest honour to own the double 
character. If he should ask me why I call him “<i>good</i>,” I should have a ready answer. It is true that “there is none good but one, that is, God,” but then he is God, and all the goodness of Deity shines forth in 
him. In my experience, I have found him good, so good, indeed, that 
all the good I have has come to me through him. He was good to me 
when I was dead in sin, for he raised me by his Spirit’s power; he has been good to me in all my needs, trials, struggles, 
and sorrows. Never could there be a better Master, for his service 
is freedom, his rule is love: I wish I were one thousandth part as 
good a servant. When he teaches me as my Rabbi, he is unspeakably 
good, his doctrine is divine, his manner is condescending, his spirit 
is gentleness itself. No error mingles with his instruction—pure is the golden truth which he brings forth, and all his teachings 
lead to goodness, sanctifying as well as edifying the disciple. Angels 
find him a good Master and delight to pay their homage at his footstool. 
The ancient saints proved him to be a good Master, and each of them 
rejoiced to sing, “I am thy servant, O Lord!” My own humble testimony must certainly be to the same effect. I will 
bear this witness before my friends and neighbours, for possibly they 
may be led by my testimony to seek my Lord Jesus as their Master. 
O that they would do so! They would never repent so wise a deed. If 
they would but take his easy yoke, they would find themselves in so 
royal a service that they would enlist in it forever.</p>

the
material upon which they worked was nothing but clay. We, too, may 
be engaged in the most
menial part of the Lord’s work, but it is a great privilege to do anything for
“the king”; and therefore we will abide in our calling, hoping that,
“although we have lien among the pots, yet shall we be as the wings 
of a dove
covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.” The text tells us of those
who <i>dwelt among</i> <i>plants and hedges</i>, having rough, rustic, hedging and
ditching work to do. They may have desired to live in the city, amid 
its life, society,
and refinement, but they kept their appointed places, for they also 
were doing the
king’s work. The place of our habitation is fixed, and we are not to remove 
from it out of whim and caprice, but seek to serve the Lord in it, 
by being a blessing to those among whom we reside. These potters and 
gardeners had <i>royal company</i>, for they dwelt “with the king” and although among hedges and plants, they dwelt with the king <i>there</i>. No lawful place, or gracious occupation, however mean, can debar 
us from communion with our divine Lord. In visiting hovels, swarming 
lodging-houses, workhouses, or jails, we may go <i>with the king</i>. In all works of faith we may count upon Jesus’ fellowship. It is when we are in his work that we may reckon upon 
his smile. Ye unknown workers who are occupied for your Lord amid 
the dirt and wretchedness of the lowest of the low, be of good cheer, 
for jewels have been found upon dunghills ere now, earthen pots have 
been filled with heavenly treasure, and ill weeds have been transformed 
into precious flowers. Dwell ye with the King for his work, and when 
he writes his chronicles your name shall be recorded.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0603pm-p3">Jesus is the great teacher of lowliness of heart. We need daily to
learn of him. See the Master taking a towel and washing his disciples’ feet!
Follower of Christ, wilt thou not humble thyself? See him as the Servant 
of servants, and
surely thou canst not be proud! Is not this sentence the compendium 
of his biography,
“He humbled himself”? Was he not on earth always stripping off first one robe
of honour and then another, till, naked, he was fastened to the cross, 
and there did he
not empty out his inmost self, pouring out his life-blood, giving 
up for all of us, till
they laid him penniless in a borrowed grave? How low was our dear 
Redeemer brought! How
then can we be proud? Stand at the foot of the cross, and count the 
purple drops by which
you have been cleansed; see the thorn-crown; mark his scourged shoulders, 
still gushing
with encrimsoned rills; see hands and feet given up to the rough iron, 
and his whole self
to mockery and scorn; see the bitterness, and the pangs, and the throes 
of inward grief,
showing themselves in his outward frame; hear the thrilling shriek, 
“My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?” And if you do not lie prostrate on the ground before
that cross, you have never seen it: if you are not humbled in the 
presence of Jesus, you
do not know him. You were so lost that nothing could save you but 
the sacrifice of
God’s only begotten. Think of that, and as Jesus stooped for you, bow 
yourself in
lowliness at his feet. A sense of Christ’s amazing love to us has a greater tendency to humble us than even 
a consciousness of our own guilt. May the Lord bring us in contemplation 
to Calvary, then our position will no longer be that of the pompous 
man of pride, but we shall take the humble place of one who loves 
much because much has been forgiven him. Pride cannot live beneath 
the cross. Let us sit there and learn our lesson, and then rise and 
carry it into practice.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0604am-p3">How sweet it is to behold the Saviour communing with his own beloved
people! There can be nothing more delightful than, by the Divine Spirit, 
to be led into
this fertile field of delight. Let the mind for an instant consider 
the history of the
Redeemer’s love, and a thousand enchanting acts of affection will suggest
themselves, all of which have had for their design the weaving of 
the heart into Christ,
and the intertwisting of the thoughts and emotions of the renewed 
soul with the mind of
Jesus. When we meditate upon this amazing love, and behold the all-glorious 
Kinsman of the
Church endowing her with all his ancient wealth, our souls may well 
faint for joy. Who is
he that can endure such a weight of love? That partial sense of it 
which the Holy Spirit
is sometimes pleased to afford, is more than the soul can contain; 
how transporting must
be a complete view of it! When the soul shall have understanding to 
discern all the
Saviour’s gifts, wisdom wherewith to estimate them, and time in which to meditate
upon them, such as the world to come will afford us, we shall then 
commune with Jesus in a
nearer manner than at present. But who can imagine the sweetness of 
such fellowship? It
must be one of the things which have not entered into the heart of 
man, but which God hath
prepared for them that love him. Oh, to burst open the door of our 
Joseph’s granaries, and see the plenty which he hath stored up for us! This 
will overwhelm us with love. By faith we see, as in a glass darkly, 
the reflected image of his unbounded treasures, but when we shall 
actually see the heavenly things themselves, with our own eyes, how 
deep will be the stream of fellowship in which our soul shall bathe 
itself! Till then our loudest sonnets shall be reserved for our loving 
benefactor, Jesus Christ our Lord, whose love to us is wonderful, 
passing the love of women.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0604pm-p3">We have seen our well-beloved Lord in the days of his flesh, humiliated
and sore vexed; for he was “despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief.” He whose brightness is as the morning, wore the sackcloth of
sorrow as his daily dress: shame was his mantle, and reproach was 
his vesture. Yet now,
inasmuch as he has triumphed over all the powers of darkness upon 
the bloody tree, our
faith beholds our King returning with dyed garments from Edom, robed 
in the splendour of
victory. How glorious must he have been in the eyes of seraphs, when 
a cloud received him
out of mortal sight, and he ascended up to heaven! Now he wears the 
glory which he had
with God or ever the earth was, and yet another glory above all—that which he has
well earned in the fight against sin, death, and hell. As victor he 
wears the illustrious
crown. Hark how the song swells high! It is a new and sweeter song: 
“Worthy is the
Lamb that was slain, for he hath redeemed us unto God by his blood!” He wears the
glory of an Intercessor who can never fail, of a Prince who can never 
be defeated, of a
Conqueror who has vanquished every foe, of a Lord who has the heart’s allegiance of every subject. Jesus wears all the glory which the 
pomp of heaven can bestow upon him, which ten thousand times ten thousand 
angels can minister to him. You cannot with your utmost stretch of 
imagination conceive his exceeding greatness; yet there will be a 
further revelation of it when he shall descend from heaven in great 
power, with all the holy angels—“Then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.” Oh, the splendour of that glory! It will ravish his people’s hearts. Nor is this the close, for eternity shall sound his praise, 
“Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever!” Reader, if you would joy in Christ’s glory hereafter, he must be glorious in your sight now. <i>Is he so</i>?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0605am-p3">Noah was shut in away from all the world by the hand of divine love. 
The door of electing purpose interposes between us and the world which 
lieth in the wicked one. We are not of the world even as our Lord 
Jesus was not of the world. Into the sin, the gaiety, the pursuits 
of the multitude we cannot enter; we cannot play in the streets of 
Vanity Fair with the children of darkness, for our heavenly Father 
has shut us in. Noah was shut in <i>with his God. “Come</i> thou into the ark,” was the Lord’s invitation, by which he clearly showed that he himself intended 
to dwell in the ark with his servant and his family. Thus all the 
chosen dwell in God and God in them. Happy people to be enclosed in 
the same circle which contains God in the Trinity of his persons, 
Father, Son, and Spirit. Let us never be inattentive to that gracious 
call, “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors 
about thee, and hide thyself as it were for a little moment until 
the indignation be overpast.” Noah was so shut in that <i>no evil could reach him</i>. Floods did but lift him heavenward, and winds did but waft him on 
his way. Outside of the ark all was ruin, but inside all was rest 
and peace. Without Christ we perish, but in Christ Jesus there is 
perfect safety. Noah was so shut in that <i>he could not</i> <i>even desire to come out</i>, and those who are in Christ Jesus are in him forever. They shall 
go no more out forever, for eternal faithfulness has shut them in, 
and infernal malice cannot drag them out. The Prince of the house 
of David shutteth and no man openeth; and when once in the last days 
as Master of the house he shall rise up and shut the door, it will 
be in vain for mere professors to knock, and cry Lord, Lord open unto 
us, for that same door which shuts in the wise virgins will shut out 
the foolish forever. Lord, shut me in by thy grace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0605pm-p3">The distinguishing mark of a Christian is his confidence in the love 
of Christ, and the yielding of his affections to Christ in return. 
First, faith sets her seal upon the man by enabling the soul to say 
with the apostle, “Christ loved me and gave himself for me.” Then love gives the countersign, and stamps upon the heart gratitude 
and love to Jesus in return. “We love him because he first loved us.” In those grand old ages, which are the heroic period of the Christian 
religion, this double mark was clearly to be seen in all believers 
in Jesus; they were men who knew the love of Christ, and rested upon 
it as a man leaneth upon a staff whose trustiness he has tried. The 
love which they felt towards the Lord was not a quiet emotion which 
they hid within themselves in the secret chamber of their souls, and 
which they only spake of in their private assemblies when they met 
on the first day of the week, and sang hymns in honour of Christ Jesus 
the crucified, but it was a passion with them of such a vehement and 
all-consuming energy, that it was visible in all their actions, spoke 
in their common talk, and looked out of their eyes even in their commonest 
glances. Love to Jesus was a flame which fed upon the core and heart 
of their being; and, therefore, from its own force burned its way 
into the outer man, and shone there. Zeal for the glory of King Jesus 
was the seal and mark of all genuine Christians. Because of their 
dependence upon Christ’s love they <i>dared</i> much, and because of their love to Christ they <i>did</i> much, and it is the same now. The children of God are ruled in their 
inmost powers by love—the love of Christ constraineth them; they rejoice that divine love 
is set upon them, they feel it shed abroad in their hearts by the 
Holy Ghost, which is given unto them, and then by force of gratitude 
they love the Saviour with a pure heart, fervently. My reader, do 
<i>you</i> love him? Ere you sleep give an honest answer to a weighty question!</p>

to the title who yet claim to belong to the Israel of God. If we are 
with confidence declaring, “So am I also an Israelite,” let us only say it after having searched our heart as in the presence 
of God. But if we can give proof that we are following Jesus, if we 
can from the heart say, “I trust him wholly, trust him only, trust him simply, trust him now, 
and trust him ever,” then the position which the saints of God hold belongs to us—all their enjoyments are our possessions; we may be the very least

our plea, and say, “Are they Israelites? so am I; therefore the promises are mine, grace

When God’s people are rejoicing that they are his, what a happiness if they 
can say, “<span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0606pm-p3.3">So am I</span> !” When they speak of being pardoned, and justified, and accepted in

its conditions and duties. We must share with God’s people in cloud as well as in sunshine. When we hear them spoken 
of with contempt and ridicule for being Christians, we must come boldly 
forward and say, “So am I.” When we see them working for Christ, giving their time, their talent, 
their whole heart to Jesus, we must be able to say, “So do I.” O let us prove our gratitude by our devotion, and live as those who, 
having claimed a privilege, are willing to take the responsibility 
connected with it.</p>

a world of mischief sin has brought into thy heart! Sin blinded thee 
so that thou couldst not see the beauty of the Saviour; it made thee 
deaf so that thou couldst not hear the Redeemer’s tender invitations. Sin turned thy feet into the way of death, and 
poured poison into the very fountain of thy being; it tainted thy 
heart, and made it “deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.” Oh, what a creature thou wast when evil had done its utmost with 
thee, before divine grace interposed! Thou wast an heir of wrath even 
as others; thou didst “run with the multitude to do evil.” Such were all of us; but Paul reminds us, “but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in 
the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” We have good reason, indeed, for hating evil when we look back and 
trace its deadly workings. Such mischief did evil do us, that our 
souls would have been lost had not omnipotent love interfered to redeem 
us. Even now it is an active enemy, ever watching to do us hurt, and 
to drag us to perdition. Therefore “hate evil,” O Christians, unless you desire trouble. If you would strew your 
path with thorns, and plant nettles in your death-pillow, then neglect 
to “hate evil:” but if you would live a happy life, and die a peaceful death, then 
walk in all the ways of holiness, hating evil, even unto the end. 
If you truly love your Saviour, and would honour him, then “hate evil.” We know of no cure for the love of evil in a Christian like abundant 
intercourse with the Lord Jesus. Dwell much with him, and it is impossible 
for you to be at peace with sin.</p>

lifted high, then be filled with zeal. For, under God, the way of 
the world’s conversion must be by the zeal of the church. Every grace shall 
do exploits, but this shall be first; prudence, knowledge, patience, 
and courage will follow in their places, but zeal must lead the van. 
It is not the extent of your knowledge, though that is useful; it 
is not the extent of your talent, though that is not to be despised; 
it is your zeal that shall do great exploits. This zeal is the fruit 
of the Holy Spirit: it draws its vital force from <i>the continued</i> <i>operations</i> of the Holy Ghost in the soul. If our inner life dwindles, if our 
heart beats slowly before God, we shall not know zeal; but if all 
be strong and vigorous within, then we cannot but feel a loving anxiety 
to see the kingdom of Christ come, and his will done on earth, even 
as it is in heaven. A deep <i>sense of gratitude</i> will nourish Christian zeal. Looking to the hole of the pit whence 
we were digged, we find abundant reason why we should spend and be 
spent for God. And zeal is also stimulated by <i>the thought of the eternal future</i>. It looks with tearful eyes down to the flames of hell, and it cannot 
slumber: it looks up with anxious gaze to the glories of heaven, and 
it cannot but bestir itself. It feels that time is short compared 
with the work to be done, and therefore it devotes all that it has 
to the cause of its Lord. And it is ever strengthened by <i>the remembrance of Christ’s example</i>. He was clothed with zeal as with a cloak. How swift the chariot-wheels 
of duty went with him! He knew no loitering by the way. Let us prove 
that we are his disciples by manifesting the same spirit of zeal.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0608am-p3">Warrior, fighting under the banner of the Lord Jesus, observe this 
verse with holy joy, for as it was in the days of old so is it now, 
if the war be of God the victory is sure. The sons of Reuben, and 
the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh could barely muster five 
and forty thousand fighting men, and yet in their war with the Hagarites, 
they slew “men, an hundred thousand,” “for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, 
because they put their trust in him.” The Lord saveth not by many nor by few; it is ours to go forth in 
Jehovah’s name if we be but a handful of men, for the Lord of Hosts is with 
us for our Captain. They did not neglect buckler, and sword, and bow, 
neither did they place their trust in these weapons; we must use all 
fitting means, but our confidence must rest in the Lord alone, for 
he is the sword and the shield of his people. The great reason of 
their extraordinary success lay in the fact that “the war was of God.” Beloved, in fighting with sin without and within, with error doctrinal 
or practical, with spiritual wickedness in high places or low places, 
with devils and the devil’s allies, you are waging Jehovah’s war, and unless he himself can be worsted, you need not fear defeat. 
Quail not before superior numbers, shrink not from difficulties or 
impossibilities, flinch not at wounds or death, smite with the two-edged 
sword of the Spirit, and the slain shall lie in heaps. The battle 
is the Lord’s and he will deliver his enemies into our hands. With steadfast foot, 
strong hand, dauntless heart, and flaming zeal, rush to the conflict, 
and the hosts of evil shall fly like chaff before the gale.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0608pm-p3">God had made a positive promise to Moses that for the space of a whole 
month he would feed the vast host in the wilderness with flesh. Moses, 
being overtaken by a fit of unbelief, looks to the outward means, 
and is at a loss to know how the promise can be fulfilled. He looked 
to the creature instead of the Creator. But doth the Creator expect 
the creature to fulfil his promise for him? No; he who makes the promise 
ever fulfils it by his own unaided omnipotence. If he speaks, it is 
done—done by himself. His promises do not depend for their fulfilment upon 
the co-operation of the puny strength of man. We can at once perceive 
the mistake which Moses made. And yet how commonly we do the same! 
God has promised to supply our needs, and we look to the creature 
to do what God has promised to do; and then, because we perceive the 
creature to be weak and feeble, we indulge in unbelief. Why look we 
to that quarter at all? Will you look to the north pole to gather 
fruits ripened in the sun? Verily, you would act no more foolishly 
if ye did this than when you look to the weak for strength, and to 
the creature to do the Creator’s work. Let us, then, put the question on the right footing. The ground 
of faith is not the sufficiency of the visible means for the performance 
of the promise, but the all-sufficiency of the invisible God, who 
will most surely do as he hath said. If after clearly seeing that 
the onus lies with the Lord and not with the creature, we dare to 
indulge in mistrust, the question of God comes home mightily to us: 
“Has the Lord’s hand waxed short?” May it happen, too, in his mercy, that with the question there may 
flash upon our souls that blessed declaration, “Thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or 
not.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0609am-p3">Some Christians are sadly prone to <i>look</i> on the <i>dark</i> side of everything, and to dwell more upon what they have gone through 
than upon what God has done for them. Ask for their impression of 
the Christian life, and they will describe their continual conflicts, 
their deep afflictions, their sad adversities, and the sinfulness 
of their hearts, yet with scarcely any allusion to the mercy and help 
which God has vouchsafed them. But a Christian whose soul is in a 
<i>healthy</i> state, will come forward joyously, and say, “I will speak, not about myself, but to the honour of my God. He hath 
brought me up out of an horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and 
set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings: and he hath put 
a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God. The Lord hath done 
great things for me, whereof I am glad.” Such an abstract of experience as this is the very best that any 
child of God can present. It is true that we endure trials, but it 
is just as true that we are delivered out of them. It is true that 
we have our corruptions, and mournfully do we know this, but it is 
quite as true that we have an all-sufficient Saviour, who overcomes 
these corruptions, and delivers us from their dominion. In looking 
back, it would be wrong to deny that we have been in the Slough of 
Despond, and have crept along the Valley of Humiliation, but it would 
be equally wicked to forget that we have been <i>through</i> them safely and profitably; we have not remained in them, thanks 
to our Almighty Helper and Leader, who has brought us “out into a wealthy place.” The deeper our troubles, the louder our thanks to God, who has led 
us through all, and preserved us until now. Our griefs cannot mar 
the melody of our praise, we reckon them to be the bass part of our 
life’s song, “He hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0609pm-p3">The Greek word here rendered <i>search</i> signifies a strict, close, diligent, curious search, such as men 
make when they are seeking gold, or hunters when they are in earnest 
after game. We must not rest content with having given a superficial 
reading to a chapter or two, but with the candle of the Spirit we 
must deliberately seek out the hidden meaning of the word. Holy Scripture 
<i>requires searching</i>—much of it can only be learned by careful study. There is milk for 
babes, but also meat for strong men. The rabbis wisely say that a 
mountain of matter hangs upon every word, yea, upon every title of 
Scripture. Tertullian exclaims, “I adore the fulness of the Scriptures.” No man who merely skims the book of God can profit thereby; we must 
dig and mine until we obtain the hid treasure. The door of the word 
only opens to the key of diligence. The Scriptures <i>claim</i> <i>searching</i>. They are the writings of God, bearing the divine stamp and imprimatur—who shall dare to treat them with levity? He who despises them despises 
the God who wrote them. God forbid that any of us should leave our 
Bibles to become swift witnesses against us in the great day of account. 
The word of God <i>will</i> <i>repay searching</i>. God does not bid us sift a mountain of chaff with here and there 
a grain of wheat in it, but the Bible is winnowed corn—we have but to open the granary door and find it. Scripture grows 
upon the student. It is full of surprises. Under the teaching of the 
Holy Spirit, to the searching eye it glows with splendour of revelation, 
like a vast temple paved with wrought gold, and roofed with rubies, 
emeralds, and all manner of gems. No merchandise is like the merchandise 
of Scripture truth. Lastly, <i>the Scriptures reveal Jesus</i>: “They are they which testify of me.” No more powerful motive can be urged upon Bible readers than this: 
he who finds Jesus finds life, heaven, all things. Happy he who, searching 
his Bible, discovers his Saviour.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0610am-p3">If God had willed it, each of us might have entered heaven at the 
moment of conversion. It was not absolutely necessary for our preparation 
for immortality that we should tarry here. It is possible for a man 
to be taken to heaven, and to be found meet to be a partaker of the 
inheritance of the saints in light, though he has but just believed 
in Jesus. It is true that our sanctification is a long and continued 
process, and we shall not be perfected till we lay aside our bodies 
and enter within the veil; but nevertheless, had the Lord so willed 
it, he might have changed us from imperfection to perfection, and 
have taken us to heaven at once. Why then are we here? Would God keep 
his children out of paradise a single moment longer than was necessary? 
Why is the army of the living God still on the battle-field when one 
charge might give them the victory? Why are his children still wandering 
hither and thither through a maze, when a solitary word from his lips 
would bring them into the centre of their hopes in heaven? The answer 
is—they are here that they may “<i>live unto the Lord</i>,” and may bring others to know his love. We remain on earth as sowers 
to scatter good seed; as ploughmen to break up the fallow ground; 
as heralds publishing salvation. We are here as the “salt of the earth,” to be a blessing to the world. We are here to glorify Christ in our 
daily life. We are here as workers for him, and as “workers together with him.” Let us see that our life answereth its end. Let us live earnest,

<p class="normal" id="d0610pm-p3">Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega of the Bible. He is the constant 
theme of its sacred pages; from first to last they testify of him. 
At the creation we at once discern him as one of the sacred Trinity; 
we catch a glimpse of him in the promise of the woman’s seed; we see him typified in the ark of Noah; we walk with Abraham, 
as he sees Messiah’s day; we dwell in the tents of Isaac and Jacob, feeding upon the 
gracious promise; we hear the venerable Israel talking of Shiloh; 
and in the numerous types of the law, we find the Redeemer abundantly 
foreshadowed. Prophets and kings, priests and preachers, all look 
one way—they all stand as the cherubs did over the ark, desiring to look within, 
and to read the mystery of God’s great propitiation. Still more manifestly in the New Testament we 
find our Lord the one pervading subject. It is not an ingot here and 
there, or dust of gold thinly scattered, but here you stand upon a 
solid floor of gold; for the whole substance of the New Testament 
is Jesus crucified, and even its closing sentence is bejewelled with 
the Redeemer’s name. We should always read Scripture in this light; we should consider 
the word to be as a mirror into which Christ looks down from heaven; 
and then we, looking into it, see his face reflected as in a glass—darkly, it is true, but still in such a way as to be a blessed preparation 
for seeing him as we shall see him face to face. This volume contains 
Jesus Christ’s letters to us, perfumed by his love. These pages are the garments of our King, and they all smell of myrrh, and 
aloes, and cassia. Scripture is the royal chariot in which Jesus rides, 
and it is paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem. The Scriptures 
are the swaddling bands of the holy child Jesus; unroll them and you 
find your Saviour. The quintessence of the word of God is Christ.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0611am-p3">There is no light in the planet but that which proceedeth from the 
sun; and there is no true love to Jesus in the heart but that which 
cometh from the Lord Jesus himself. From this overflowing fountain 
of the infinite love of God, all our love to God must spring. This 
must ever be a great and certain truth, that we love him for no other 
reason than because he first loved us. Our love to him is <i>the fair offspring</i> of his love to us. Cold admiration, when studying the works of God, 
anyone may have, but the warmth of love can only be kindled in the 
heart by God’s Spirit. How great the wonder that such as we should ever have been 
brought to love Jesus at all! How marvellous that when we had rebelled 
against him, he should, by a display of such amazing love, seek to 
draw us back. No! never should we have had a grain of love towards 
God unless it had been sown in us by the sweet seed of his love to 
us. Love, then, has for its parent the love of God shed abroad in 
the heart: but after it is thus divinely born, it must <i>be divinely nourished</i>. Love is an exotic; it is not a plant which will flourish naturally 
in human soil, it must be watered from above. Love to Jesus is a flower 
of a delicate nature, and if it received no nourishment but that which 
could be drawn from the rock of our hearts it would soon wither. As 
love comes from heaven, so it must feed on heavenly bread. It cannot 
exist in the wilderness unless it be fed by manna from on high. Love 
must feed on love. The very soul and life of our love to God is his 
love to us.</p>

woes as a hammer, dashing to shivers bundle after bundle of our sins, 
those poisoned “arrows of the bow;” trampling on every indictment, and destroying every accusation. What 
glorious blows the mighty Breaker gives with a hammer far more ponderous

Beloved, no sin of a believer can now be an arrow mortally to wound 
him, no condemnation can now be a sword to kill him, for the punishment 
of our sin was borne by Christ, a full atonement was made for all 
our iniquities by our blessed Substitute and Surety. Who now accuseth? 
Who now condemneth? Christ hath died, yea rather, hath risen again. 
Jesus has emptied the quivers of hell, has quenched every fiery dart,

with the splinters and relics of the weapons of hell’s warfare, which are only visible to us to remind us of our former

<p class="normal" id="d0612am-p3">It is well frequently to weigh ourselves in the scale of God’s Word. You will find it a holy exercise to read some psalm of David, 
and, as you meditate upon each verse, to ask yourself, “Can I say this? Have I felt as David felt? Has my heart ever been 
broken on account of sin, as his was when he penned his penitential 
psalms? Has my soul been full of true confidence in the hour of difficulty 
as his was when he sang of God’s mercies in the cave of Adullam, or in the holds of Engedi? Do I 
take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord?” Then turn to the life of Christ, and as you read, ask yourselves 
how far you are conformed to his likeness. Endeavour to discover whether 
you have the meekness, the humility, the lovely spirit which he constantly 
inculcated and displayed. Take, then, the epistles, and see whether 
you can go with the apostle in what he said of his experience. Have 
you ever cried out as he did—“O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this 
death?” Have you ever felt his self-abasement? Have you seemed to yourself 
the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints? Have 
you known anything of his devotion? Could you join with him and say, 
“For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain”? If we thus read God’s Word as a test of our spiritual condition, we shall have good reason 
to stop many a time and say, “Lord, I feel I have never yet been here, O bring me here! give me 
true penitence, such as this I read of. Give me real faith; give me 
warmer zeal; inflame me with more fervent love; grant me the grace 
of meekness; make me more like Jesus. Let me no longer be ‘found wanting,’ when weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, lest I be found wanting 
in the scales of judgment.” “Judge yourselves that ye be not judged.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0612pm-p3">The apostle uses the perfect tense and says, “Who <i>hath</i> saved us.” Believers in Christ Jesus <i>are</i> saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state, 
and may ultimately be saved, but they <i>are</i> already saved. Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed upon the 
dying bed, and to be sung of in a future state above, but a matter 
to be obtained, received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian 
is perfectly saved <i>in God’s purpose</i>; God has ordained him unto salvation, and that purpose is complete. 
He is saved also as to the <i>price</i> <i>which has been paid for him</i>: “It is finished” was the cry of the Saviour ere he died. The believer is also perfectly 
saved <i>in his covenant head</i>, for as he fell in Adam, so he lives in Christ. This complete salvation 
is accompanied by <i>a holy</i> <i>calling</i>. Those whom the Saviour saved upon the cross are in due time effectually 
called by the power of God the Holy Spirit unto holiness: they leave 
their sins; they endeavour to be like Christ; they choose holiness, 
not out of any compulsion, but from the stress of a new nature, which 
leads them to rejoice in holiness just as naturally as aforetime they 
delighted in sin. God neither chose them nor called them because they 
were holy, but he called them that they might be holy, and holiness 
is the beauty produced by his workmanship in them. The excellencies 
which we see in a believer are as much the work of God as the atonement 
itself. Thus is brought out very sweetly the fulness of the grace 
of God. Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author 
of it: and what motive but grace could move him to save the guilty? 
Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord works in such a manner 
that our righteousness is forever excluded. Such is the believer’s privilege—<i>a present</i> <i>salvation</i>; such is the evidence that he is called to it—<i>a</i> <i>holy life</i>.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0613am-p3">Jesus says, “take freely.” He wants no payment or preparation. He seeks no recommendation from 
our virtuous emotions. If you have no good feelings, if you be but 
willing, you are invited; therefore come! You have no belief and no 
repentance,—come to him, and he will give them to you. Come just as you are, and 
take “Freely,” without money and without price. He gives himself to needy ones. 
The drinking fountains at the corners of our streets are valuable 
institutions; and we can hardly imagine any one so foolish as to feel 
for his purse, when he stands before one of them, and to cry, “I cannot drink because I have not five pounds in my pocket.” However poor the man is, there is the fountain, and just as he is 
he may drink of it. Thirsty passengers, as they go by, whether they 
are dressed in fustian or in broadcloth, do not look for any warrant 
for drinking; its being there is their warrant for taking its water 
freely. The liberality of some good friends has put the refreshing 
crystal there and we take it, and ask no questions. Perhaps the only 
persons who need go thirsty through the street where there is a drinking 
fountain, are the fine ladies and gentlemen who are in their carriages. 
They are very thirsty, but cannot think of being so vulgar as to get 
out to drink. It would demean them, they think, to drink at a common 
drinking fountain: so they ride by with parched lips. Oh, how many 
there are who are rich in their own good works and cannot therefore 
come to Christ! “I will not be saved,” they say, “in the same way as the harlot or the swearer.” What! go to heaven in the same way as a chimney sweep. Is there no 
pathway to glory but the path which led the thief there? I will not 
be saved that way. Such proud boasters must remain without the living 
water; but, “<span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0613am-p3.1">Whosoever will, let him</span>  <i>TAKE THE WATER OF LIFE FREELY</i>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0613pm-p3">Here we have two great lessons—what to deprecate and what to supplicate. The happiest state of a 
Christian is the holiest state. As there is the most heat nearest 
to the sun, so there is the most happiness nearest to Christ. No Christian 
enjoys comfort when his eyes are fixed on vanity—he finds no satisfaction unless his soul is quickened in the ways 
of God. The world may win happiness elsewhere, but he cannot. I do 
not blame ungodly men for rushing to their pleasures. Why should I? 
Let them have their fill. That is all they have to enjoy. A converted 
wife who despaired of her husband was always very kind to him, for 
she said, “I fear that this is the only world in which he will be happy, and 
therefore I have made up my mind to make him as happy as I can in 
it.” Christians must seek their delights in a higher sphere than the insipid 
frivolities or sinful enjoyments of the world. Vain pursuits are dangerous 
to renewed souls. We have heard of a philosopher who, while he looked 
<i>up</i> to the stars, fell into a pit; but how deeply do they fall who look 
<i>down</i>. Their fall is fatal. No Christian is safe when his soul is slothful, 
and his God is far from him. Every Christian is always safe as to 
the great matter of his standing in Christ, but he is not safe as 
regards his experience in holiness, and communion with Jesus in this 
life. Satan does not often attack a Christian who is living near to 
God. It is when the Christian departs from his God, becomes spiritually 
starved, and endeavours to feed on vanities, that the devil discovers 
his vantage hour. He may sometimes stand foot to foot with the child 
of God who is active in his Master’s service, but the battle is generally short: he who slips as he goes 
down into the Valley of Humiliation, every time he takes a false step 
invites Apollyon to assail him. O for grace to walk humbly with our 
God!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0614am-p3">The teaching of these words must seem very surprising to those who 
are strangers to vital godliness, but to the sincere believer it is 
only the inculcation of a recognized truth. The life of the believer 
is here described as a <i>delight</i> in God, and we are thus certified of the great fact that true religion 
overflows with happiness and joy. Ungodly persons and mere professors 
never look upon religion as a joyful thing; to them it is service, 
duty, or necessity, but never pleasure or delight. If they attend 
to religion at all, it is either that they may gain thereby, or else 
because they dare not do otherwise. The thought of <i>delight</i> in religion is so strange to most men, that no two words in their 
language stand further apart than “holiness” and “delight.” But believers who know Christ, understand that delight and faith 
are so blessedly united, that the gates of hell cannot prevail to 
separate them. They who love God with all their hearts, find that 
his ways are ways of pleasantness, and all his paths are peace. Such 
joys, such brimful delights, such overflowing blessednesses, do the 
saints discover in their Lord, that so far from serving him from custom, 
they would follow him though all the world cast out his name as evil. 
We fear not God because of any compulsion; our faith is no fetter, 
our profession is no bondage, we are not dragged to holiness, nor 
driven to duty. No, our piety is our pleasure, our hope is our happiness, 
our duty is our delight.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0614am-p4">Delight and true religion are as allied as root and flower; as indivisible

<p class="normal" id="d0614pm-p3">A deep sense and clear sight of sin, its heinousness, and the punishment 
which it deserves, should make us lie low before the throne. We have 
sinned as Christians. Alas! that it should be so. Favoured as we have 
been, we have yet been ungrateful: privileged beyond most, we have 
not brought forth fruit in proportion. Who is there, although he may 
long have been engaged in the Christian warfare, that will not blush 
when he looks back upon the past? As for our days before we were regenerated, 
may they be forgiven and forgotten; but since then, though we have 
not sinned as before, yet we have sinned against light and against 
love—light which has really penetrated our minds, and love in which we 
have rejoiced. Oh, the atrocity of the sin of a pardoned soul! An 
unpardoned sinner sins cheaply compared with the sin of one of God’s own elect ones, who has had communion with Christ and leaned his 
head upon Jesus’ bosom. Look at David! Many will talk of his sin, but I pray you look 
at his repentance, and hear his broken bones, as each one of them 
moans out its dolorous confession! Mark his tears, as they fall upon 
the ground, and the deep sighs with which he accompanies the softened 
music of his harp! We have erred: let us, therefore, seek the spirit 
of penitence. Look, again, at Peter! We speak much of Peter’s denying his Master. Remember, it is written, “He wept bitterly.” Have <i>we</i> no denials of our Lord to be lamented with tears? Alas! these sins 
of ours, before and after conversion, would consign us to the place 
of inextinguishable fire if it were not for the sovereign mercy which 
has made us to differ, snatching us like brands from the burning. 
My soul, bow down under a sense of thy natural sinfulness, and worship 
thy God. Admire the grace which saves thee—the mercy which spares thee—the love which pardons thee!</p>

the soul at the new birth divine light is poured as the precursor 
of salvation; where there is not enough light to reveal our own darkness 
and to make us long for the Lord Jesus, there is no evidence of salvation. 
After conversion our God is our joy, comfort, guide, teacher, and 
in every sense our light: he is light within, light around, light 
reflected from us, and light to be revealed to us. Note, it is not 
said merely that the Lord gives light, but that he is light; nor that 
he gives salvation, but that he is salvation; he, then, who by faith 
has laid hold upon God, has all covenant blessings in his possession. 
This being made sure as a fact, the argument drawn from it is put

to be feared, for the Lord, our light, destroys them; and the damnation 
of hell is not to be dreaded by us, for the Lord is our salvation. 
This is a very different challenge from that of boastful Goliath, 
for it rests, not upon the conceited vigour of an arm of flesh, but 
upon the real power of the omnipotent I AM. “<i>The Lord is the strength of my life</i>.” Here is a third glowing epithet, to show that the writer’s hope was fastened with a threefold cord which could not be broken. 
We may well accumulate terms of praise where the Lord lavishes deeds 
of grace. Our life derives all its strength from God; and if he deigns 
to make us strong, we cannot be weakened by all the machinations of 
the adversary. “<i>Of whom shall I be afraid</i>?” The bold question looks into the future as well as the present. “If God be for us,” who can be against us, either now or in time to come?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0617am-p3"><i>The prayer itself is remarkable</i>, for it is <i>short</i>, but <i>seasonable, sententious</i>, and <i>suggestive</i>. David mourned the fewness of faithful men, and therefore lifted 
up his heart in supplication—when the creature failed, he flew to the Creator. He evidently felt 
his own weakness, or he would not have cried for help; but at the 
same time he intended honestly to exert himself for the cause of truth, 
for the word “help” is inapplicable where we ourselves do nothing. There is much of <i>directness, clearness of perception</i>, and <i>distinctness of</i> <i>utterance</i> in this petition of two words; much more, indeed, than in the long 
rambling outpourings of certain professors. The Psalmist runs straight-forward 
to his God, with a well-considered prayer; he knows what he is seeking, 
and where to seek it. Lord, teach us to pray in the same blessed manner.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0617am-p4"><i>The occasions for the use of this prayer are frequent</i>. In providential afflictions how suitable it is for tried believers 
who find all helpers failing them. Students, in <i>doctrinal</i> <i>difficulties</i>, may often obtain aid by lifting up this cry of “Help, Lord,” to the Holy Spirit, the great Teacher. Spiritual warriors in <i>inward conflicts</i> may send to the throne for reinforcements, and this will be a model 
for their request. Workers in <i>heavenly labour</i> may thus obtain grace in time of need. Seeking sinners, in <i>doubts and alarms</i>, may offer up the same weighty supplication; in fact, in all these 
cases, times, and places, this will serve the turn of needy souls. 
“Help, Lord,” will suit us living and dying, suffering or labouring, rejoicing 
or sorrowing. In him our help is found, let us not be slack to cry 
to him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0617am-p5"><i>The answer to the prayer is certain</i>, if it be sincerely offered through Jesus. The Lord’s character assures us that he will not leave his people; his relationship 
as Father and Husband guarantee us his aid; his gift of Jesus is a 
pledge of every good thing; and his sure promise stands, “Fear not, <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0617am-p5.1">I will help thee</span>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0617pm-p3">Famous was the well of Beer in the wilderness, because it was <i>the subject of a promise</i>: “That is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people 
together, and I will give them water.” The people needed water, and it was promised by their gracious God. 
We need fresh supplies of heavenly grace, and in the covenant the 
Lord has pledged himself to give all we require. The well next became 
<i>the cause of a song</i>. Before the water gushed forth, cheerful faith prompted the people 
to sing; and as they saw the crystal fount bubbling up, the music 
grew yet more joyous. In like manner, we who believe the promise of 
God should rejoice in the prospect of divine revivals in our souls, 
and as we experience them our holy joy should overflow. Are we thirsting? 
Let us not murmur, but sing. Spiritual thirst is bitter to bear, but 
we need not bear it—the promise indicates a well; let us be of good heart, and look for 
it. Moreover, the well was <i>the centre of prayer</i>. “Spring up, O well.” What God has engaged to give, we must enquire after, or we manifest 
that we have neither desire nor faith. This evening let us ask that 
the Scripture we have read, and our devotional exercises, may not 
be an empty formality, but a channel of grace to our souls. O that 
God the Holy Spirit would work in us with all his mighty power, filling 
us with all the fulness of God. Lastly, the well was <i>the object of effort</i>. “The nobles of the people digged it with their staves.” The Lord would have us active in obtaining grace. Our staves are 
ill adapted for digging in the sand, but we must use them to the utmost 
of our ability. Prayer must not be neglected; the assembling of ourselves 
together must not be forsaken; ordinances must not be slighted. The 
Lord will give us his peace most plenteously, but not in a way of 
idleness. Let us, then, bestir ourselves to seek him in whom are all 
our fresh springs.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0618am-p3">Jesus, the Redeemer, is altogether ours and ours forever. All the 
<i>offices</i> of Christ are held on our behalf. He is king for us, priest for us, 
and prophet for us. Whenever we read a new title of the Redeemer, 
let us appropriate him as ours under that name as much as under any 
other. The shepherd’s staff, the father’s rod, the captain’s sword, the priest’s mitre, the prince’s sceptre, the prophet’s mantle, all are ours. Jesus hath no dignity which he will not employ 
for our exaltation, and no prerogative which he will not exercise 
for our defence. His fulness of <i>Godhead</i> is our unfailing, inexhaustible treasure-house.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0618am-p4">His <i>manhood</i> also, which he took upon him for us, is ours in all its perfection. 
To us our gracious Lord communicates the spotless virtue of a stainless 
character; to us he gives the meritorious efficacy of a devoted life; 
on us he bestows the reward procured by obedient submission and incessant 
service. He makes the unsullied garment of his life our covering beauty; 
the glittering virtues of his character our ornaments and jewels; 
and the superhuman meekness of his death our boast and glory. He bequeaths 
us his manger, from which to learn how God came down to man; and his 
Cross to teach us how man may go up to God. All his thoughts, emotions, 
actions, utterances, miracles, and intercessions, were for us. He 
trod the road of sorrow on our behalf, and hath made over to us as 
his heavenly legacy the full results of all the labours of his life. 
He is now as much ours as heretofore; and he blushes not to acknowledge 
himself “<i>our</i> Lord Jesus Christ,” though he is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and 
Lord of lords. Christ everywhere and every way is our Christ, forever 
and ever most richly to enjoy. O my soul, by the power of the Holy 
Spirit! call him this morning, “thy Redeemer.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0618pm-p3">The heart of the believer is Christ’s garden. He bought it with his precious blood, and he enters it and 
claims it as his own. A garden <i>implies separation</i>. It is not the open common; it is not a wilderness; it is walled 
around, or hedged in. Would that we could see the wall of separation 
between the church and the world made broader and stronger. It makes 
one sad to hear Christians saying, “Well, there is no harm in this; there is no harm in that,” thus getting as near to the world as possible. Grace is at a low 
ebb in that soul which can even raise the question of how far it may 
go in worldly conformity. A garden is <i>a place of beauty</i>, it far surpasses the wild uncultivated lands. The genuine Christian 
must seek to be more excellent in his life than the best moralist, 
because Christ’s garden ought to produce the best flowers in all the world. Even 
the best is poor compared with Christ’s deservings; let us not put him off with withering and dwarf plants. 
The rarest, richest, choicest lilies and roses ought to bloom in the 
place which Jesus calls his own. The garden is <i>a place of growth</i>. The saints are not to remain undeveloped, always mere buds and blossoms. 
We should grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour 
Jesus Christ. Growth should be rapid where Jesus is the Husbandman, 
and the Holy Spirit the dew from above. A garden is <i>a place of retirement</i>. So the Lord Jesus Christ would have us reserve our souls as a place 
in which he can manifest himself, as he doth not unto the world. O 
that Christians were more retired, that they kept their hearts more 
closely shut up for Christ! We often worry and trouble ourselves, 
like Martha, with much serving, so that we have not the room for Christ 
that Mary had, and do not sit at his feet as we should. The Lord grant 
the sweet showers of his grace to water his garden this day.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0619am-p3">Rich were the blessings of this day if all of us were filled with 
the Holy Ghost. The consequences of this sacred filling of the soul 
it would be impossible to overestimate. Life, comfort, light, purity, 
power, peace; and many other precious blessings are inseparable from 
the Spirit’s benign presence. As sacred <i>oil</i>, he anoints the head of the believer, sets him apart to the priesthood 
of saints, and gives him grace to execute his office aright. As the 
only truly purifying <i>water</i> he cleanses us from the power of sin and sanctifies us unto holiness, 
working in us to will and to do of the Lord’s good pleasure. As the <i>light</i>, he manifested to us at first our lost estate, and now he reveals 
the Lord Jesus to us and in us, and guides us in the way of righteousness. 
Enlightened by his pure celestial ray, we are no more darkness but 
light in the Lord. <i>As fire</i>, he both purges us from dross, and sets our consecrated nature on 
a blaze. He is the sacrificial flame by which we are enabled to offer 
our whole souls as a living sacrifice unto God. As heavenly <i>dew</i>, he removes our barrenness and fertilizes our lives. O that he would 
drop from above upon us at this early hour! Such morning dew would 
be a sweet commencement for the day. As the <i>dove</i>, with wings of peaceful love he broods over his Church and over the 
souls of believers, and as a Comforter he dispels the cares and doubts 
which mar the peace of his beloved. He descends upon the chosen as 
upon the Lord in Jordan, and bears witness to their sonship by working 
in them a filial spirit by which they cry Abba, Father. As the <i>wind</i>, he brings the breath of life to men; blowing where he listeth he 
performs the quickening operations by which the spiritual creation 
is animated and sustained. Would to God, that we might feel his presence 
this day and every day.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0619pm-p3">Surely if there be a happy verse in the Bible it is this—“My Beloved is mine, and I am his.” So peaceful, so full of assurance, so overrunning with happiness 
and contentment is it, that it might well have been written by the 
same hand which penned the twenty-third Psalm. Yet though the prospect 
is exceeding fair and lovely—earth cannot show its superior—it is not entirely a sunlit landscape. There is a cloud in the sky 
which casts a shadow over the scene. Listen, “Until the day break, and the shadows flee away.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0619pm-p4">There is a word, too, about the “mountains of Bether,” or, “the mountains of division,” and to our love, anything like division is bitterness. Beloved, this 
may be your present state of mind; you do not doubt your salvation; 
you know that Christ is yours, but you are not feasting with him. 
You understand your vital interest in him, so that you have no shadow 
of a doubt of your being his, and of his being yours, but still his 
left hand is not under your head, nor doth his right hand embrace 
you. A shade of sadness is cast over your heart, perhaps by affliction, 
certainly by the temporary absence of your Lord, so even while exclaiming, 
“I am his,” you are forced to take to your knees, and to pray, “Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0619pm-p5">“Where is he?” asks the soul. And the answer comes, “He feedeth among the lilies.” If we would find Christ, we must get into communion with his people, 
we must come to the ordinances with his saints. Oh, for an evening 
glimpse of him! Oh, to sup with him tonight!</p>

in some sense our siftings are <i>directly the work of</i> <i>heaven</i>, for the text says, “I will sift the house of Israel.” Satan, like a drudge, may hold the sieve, hoping to destroy the corn; 
but the overruling hand of the Master is accomplishing the purity 
of the grain by the very process which the enemy intended to be destructive. 
Precious, but much sifted corn of the Lord’s floor, be comforted by the blessed fact that the Lord directeth 
both flail and sieve to his own glory, and to thine eternal profit.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0620am-p4">The Lord Jesus will surely use the fan which is in his hand, and will 
<i>divide the precious from the vile</i>. All are not Israel that are of Israel; the heap on the barn floor 
is not clean provender, and hence the winnowing process must be performed. 
In the sieve true weight alone has power. Husks and chaff being devoid 
of substance must fly before the wind, and only solid corn will remain.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0620am-p5">Observe the <i>complete safety of the Lord’s wheat</i>; even the least grain has a promise of preservation. God himself 
sifts, and therefore it is stern and terrible work; he sifts them 
in all places, “among all nations”; he sifts them in the most effectual manner, “like as corn is sifted in a sieve”; and yet for all this, not the smallest, lightest, or most shrivelled 
grain, is permitted to fall to the ground. Every individual believer 
is precious in the sight of the Lord, a shepherd would not lose one 
sheep, nor a jeweller one diamond, nor a mother one child, nor a man 
one limb of his body, nor will the Lord lose one of his redeemed people. 
However little we may be, if we are the Lord's, we may rejoice that 
we are preserved in Christ Jesus.</p>

our attendance at the means of grace, and our reading of good books, 
could not fail to enrich us spiritually. He will not lose his loaf 
who has taken care at once to eat it, neither can he be deprived of 
the benefit of the doctrine who has already acted upon it. Most readers

be readers only, but doers, of the word. <i>The practice of truth is</i> <i>the most profitable reading of it</i>. Should the reader be impressed with any duty while perusing these 
pages, let him hasten to fulfil it before the holy glow has departed 
from his soul, and let him leave his nets, and all that he has, sooner

calls you. Happy is the writer who shall meet with readers resolved

<p class="normal" id="d0621pm-p3">The foundation upon which our faith rests is this, that “God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing 
their trespasses unto them.” The great fact on which genuine faith relies is, that “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,” and that “Christ also hath suffered for sin, the just for the unjust, that he 
might bring us to God”; “Who himself bare our sins in his own body on the tree”; “For the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes 
we are healed.” In one word, the great pillar of the Christian’s hope is <i>substitution</i>. The vicarious sacrifice of Christ for the guilty, Christ being made 
sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in him, 
Christ offering up a true and proper expiatory and substitutionary 
sacrifice in the room, place, and stead of as many as the Father gave 
him, who are known to God by name, and are recognized in their own 
hearts by their trusting in Jesus—this is the cardinal fact of the gospel. If this foundation were removed, 
what could we do? But it standeth firm as the throne of God. We know 
it; we rest on it; we rejoice in it; and our delight is to hold it, 
to meditate upon it, and to proclaim it, while we desire to be actuated 
and moved by gratitude for it in every part of our life and conversation. 
In these days a direct attack is made upon the doctrine of the atonement. 
Men cannot bear substitution. They gnash their teeth at the thought 
of the Lamb of God bearing the sin of man. But we, who know by experience 
the preciousness of this truth, will proclaim it in defiance of them 
confidently and unceasingly. We will neither dilute it nor change 
it, nor fritter it away in any shape or fashion. It shall still be 
Christ, a <i>positive substitute</i>, bearing human guilt and suffering in the stead of men. We cannot, 
dare not, give it up, for it is our life, and despite every controversy 
we feel that <i>“Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d0622am-p3">Christ himself is the builder of his spiritual temple, and he has 
built it on the mountains of his unchangeable affection, his omnipotent 
grace, and his infallible truthfulness. But as it was in Solomon’s temple, so in this; the materials need making ready. There are the 
“Cedars of Lebanon,” but they are not framed for the building; they are not cut down, 
and shaped, and made into those planks of cedar, whose odoriferous 
beauty shall make glad the courts of the Lord’s house in Paradise. There are also the rough stones still in the 
quarry, they must be hewn thence, and squared. All this is Christ’s own work. Each individual believer is being prepared, and polished, 
and made ready for his place in the temple; but Christ’s own hand performs the preparation-work. Afflictions cannot sanctify, 
excepting as they are used by him to this end. Our prayers and efforts 
cannot make us ready for heaven, apart from the hand of Jesus, who 
fashioneth our hearts aright.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0622am-p4">As in the building of Solomon’s temple, “there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in 
the house,” because all was brought perfectly ready for the exact spot it was 
to occupy—so is it with the temple which Jesus builds; the making ready is all 
done on earth. When we reach heaven, there will be no sanctifying 
us there, no squaring us with affliction, no planing us with suffering. 
No, we must be made meet here—all <i>that</i> Christ will do beforehand; and when he has done it, we shall be ferried 
by a loving hand across the stream of death, and brought to the heavenly 
Jerusalem, to abide as eternal pillars in the temple of our Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0622pm-p3">We have many things in our possession at the present moment which 
can be shaken, and it ill becomes a Christian man to set much store 
by them, for there is nothing stable beneath these rolling skies; 
change is written upon all things. Yet, we have certain “things which <i>cannot</i> be shaken,” and I invite you this evening to think of them, that if the things 
which can be shaken should all be taken away, you may derive real 
comfort from the things that cannot be shaken, which will remain. 
Whatever your losses have been, or may be, you enjoy present salvation. 
You are standing at the foot of his cross, trusting alone in the merit 
of Jesus’ precious blood, and no rise or fall of the markets can interfere 
with your salvation in him; no breaking of banks, no failures and 
bankruptcies can touch that. Then you are <i>a child of God</i> this evening. God is your Father. No change of circumstances can 
ever rob you of that. Although by losses brought to poverty, and stripped 
bare, you can say, “He is my Father still. In my Father’s house are many mansions; therefore will I not be troubled.” You have another permanent blessing, namely, <i>the love of Jesus Christ</i>. He who is God and Man loves you with all the strength of his affectionate 
nature—nothing can affect that. The fig tree may not blossom, and the flocks 
may cease from the field, it matters not to the man who can sing, 
“My Beloved is mine, and I am his.” Our best portion and richest heritage we cannot lose. Whatever troubles 
come, let us play the man; let us show that we are not such little 
children as to be cast down by what may happen in this poor fleeting 
state of time. Our country is Immanuel’s land, our hope is above the sky, and therefore, calm as the summer’s ocean; we will see the wreck of everything earthborn, and yet rejoice 
in the God of our salvation.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0623am-p3">A cake not turned is <i>uncooked on one side</i>; and so Ephraim was, in many respects, untouched by divine grace: 
though there was some partial obedience, there was very much rebellion 
left. My soul, I charge thee, see whether this be thy case. Art thou 
thorough in the things of God? Has grace gone through the very centre 
of thy being so as to be felt in its divine operations in all thy 
powers, thy actions, thy words, and thy thoughts? To be sanctified, 
spirit, soul, and body, should be thine aim and prayer; and although 
sanctification may not be perfect in thee anywhere in degree, yet 
it must be universal in its action; there must not be the appearance 
of holiness in one place and reigning sin in another, else thou, too, 
wilt be a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0623am-p4">A cake not turned is <i>soon burnt on the side nearest the</i> <i>fire</i>, and although no man can have too much religion, there are some who 
seem burnt black with bigoted zeal for that part of truth which they 
have received, or are charred to a cinder with a vainglorious Pharisaic 
ostentation of those religious performances which suit their humour. 
The assumed appearance of superior sanctity frequently accompanies 
a total absence of all vital godliness. The saint in public is a devil 
in private. He deals in flour by day and in soot by night. The cake 
which is burned on one side, is dough on the other.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0623am-p5"><i>If it be so with me, O Lord, turn me</i>! Turn my unsanctified nature to the fire of thy love and let it feel 
the sacred glow, and let my burnt side cool a little while I learn 
my own weakness and want of heat when I am removed from thy heavenly 
flame. Let me not be found a double-minded man, but one entirely under 
the powerful influence of reigning grace; for well I know if I am 
left like a cake unturned, and am not on both sides the subject of 
thy grace, I must be consumed forever amid everlasting burnings.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0623pm-p3">Even in this world saints are God’s children, but men cannot discover them to be so, except by certain 
moral characteristics. The adoption is not manifested, the children 
are not yet openly declared. Among the Romans a man might adopt a 
child, and keep it private for a long time: but there was a second 
adoption in public; when the child was brought before the constituted 
authorities its former garments were taken off, and the father who 
took it to be his child gave it raiment suitable to its new condition 
of life. “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what 
we shall be.” We are not yet arrayed in the apparel which befits the royal family 
of heaven; we are wearing in this flesh and blood just what we wore 
as the sons of Adam; but we know that “when <i>he</i> shall appear” who is the “first-born among many brethren,” we shall be like him, we shall see him as he is. Cannot you imagine 
that a child taken from the lowest ranks of society, and adopted by 
a Roman senator, would say to himself, “I long for the day when I shall be publicly adopted. Then I shall 
leave off these plebeian garments, and be robed as becomes my senatorial 
rank”? Happy in what he has received, for that very reason he groans to 
get the fulness of what is promised him. So it is with us today. We 
are waiting till we shall put on our proper garments, and shall be 
manifested as the children of God. We are young nobles, and have not 
yet worn our coronets. We are young brides, and the marriage day is 
not yet come, and by the love our Spouse bears us, we are led to long 
and sigh for the bridal morning. Our very happiness makes us groan 
after more; our joy, like a swollen spring, longs to well up like 
an Iceland geyser, leaping to the skies, and it heaves and groans 
within our spirit for want of space and room by which to manifest 
itself to men.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0624am-p3">It is fondly imagined by some that it must have involved very special 
privileges to have been the mother of our Lord, because they supposed 
that she had the benefit of looking into his very heart in a way in 
which we cannot hope to do. There may be an appearance of plausibility 
in the supposition, but not much. We do not know that Mary knew more 
than others; what she did know she did well to lay up in her heart; 
but she does not appear from anything we read in the Evangelists to 
have been a better-instructed believer than any other of Christ’s disciples. All that she knew we also may discover. Do you wonder 
that we should say so? Here is a text to prove it: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show 
them his covenant.” Remember the Master’s words—“Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what 
his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that 
I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.” So blessedly does this Divine Revealer of secrets tell us his heart, 
that he keepeth back nothing which is profitable to us; his own assurance 
is, “If it were not so, I would have told you.” Doth he not this day manifest himself unto us as he doth not unto 
the world? It is even so; and therefore we will not ignorantly cry 
out, “Blessed is the womb that bare thee,” but we will intelligently bless God that, having heard the Word and 
kept it, we have first of all as true a communion with the Saviour 
as the Virgin had, and in the second place as true an acquaintance 
with the secrets of his heart as she can be supposed to have obtained. 
Happy soul to be thus privileged!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0624pm-p3">The narrative of the manly courage and marvellous deliverance of the 
three holy children, or rather champions, is well calculated to excite 
in the minds of believers firmness and steadfastness in upholding 
the truth in the teeth of tyranny and in the very jaws of death. Let 
young Christians especially learn from their example, both in matters 
of faith in religion, and matters of uprightness in business, never 
to sacrifice their consciences. Lose all rather than lose your integrity, 
and when all else is gone, still hold fast a clear conscience as the 
rarest jewel which can adorn the bosom of a mortal. Be not guided 
by the will-o’-the-wisp of policy, but by the pole-star of divine authority. Follow 
the right at all hazards. When you see no present advantage, walk 
by faith and not by sight. Do God the honour to trust him when it 
comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle. See whether he 
will be your debtor! See if he doth not even in this life prove his 
word that “Godliness, with contentment, is great gain,” and that they who “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, shall have all 
these things added unto them.” Should it happen that, in the providence of God, you are a loser 
by conscience, you shall find that if the Lord pays you not back in 
the silver of earthly prosperity, he will discharge his promise in 
the gold of spiritual joy. Remember that a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of that which he possesseth. 
To wear a guileless spirit, to have a heart void of offence, to have 
the favour and smile of God, is greater riches than the mines of Ophir 
could yield, or the traffic of Tyre could win. “Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and inward 
contention therewith.” An ounce of heart's-ease is worth a ton of gold.</p>

mountains. When you are at the base you see but little: the mountain 
itself appears to be but one-half as high as it really is. Confined 
in a little valley, you discover scarcely anything but the rippling 
brooks as they descend into the stream at the foot of the mountain. 
Climb the first rising knoll, and the valley lengthens and widens 
beneath your feet. Go higher, and you see the country for four or 
five miles round, and you are delighted with the widening prospect. 
Mount still, and the scene enlarges; till at last, when you are on 
the summit, and look east, west, north, and south, you see almost 
all England lying before you. Yonder is a forest in some distant county, 
perhaps two hundred miles away, and here the sea, and there a shining 
river and the smoking chimneys of a manufacturing town, or the masts 
of the ships in a busy port. All these things please and delight you, 
and you say, “I could not have imagined that so much could be seen at this elevation.” Now, the Christian life is of the same order. When we first believe 
in Christ we see but little of him. The higher we climb the more we 
discover of his beauties. But who has ever gained the summit? Who 
has known all the heights and depths of the love of Christ which passes 
knowledge? Paul, when grown old, sitting grey-haired, shivering in 
a dungeon in Rome, could say with greater emphasis than we can, “I know whom I have believed,” for each experience had been like the climbing of a hill, each trial 
had been like ascending another summit, and his death seemed like 
gaining the top of the mountain, from which he could see the whole 
of the faithfulness and the love of him to whom he had committed his 
soul. Get thee up, dear friend, into the high mountain.</p>

assured that your religion is vain. Are you satisfied with anything 
short of a conscious knowledge of your union and interest in Christ? 
Then woe unto you. If you profess to be a Christian, yet find full 
satisfaction in worldly pleasures and pursuits, your profession is 
false. If your soul can stretch herself at rest, and find the bed 
long enough, and the coverlet broad enough to cover her in the chambers 
of sin, then you are a hypocrite, and far enough from any right thoughts 
of Christ or perception of his preciousness. But if, on the other 
hand, you feel that if you could indulge in sin without punishment, 
yet it would be a punishment of itself; and that if you could have 
the whole world, and abide in it forever, it would be quite enough 
misery not to be parted from it; for your God—your God—is what your soul craves after; then be of good courage, thou art 
a child of God. With all thy sins and imperfections, take this to 
thy comfort: if thy soul has no rest in sin, thou are not as the sinner 
is! If thou art still crying after and craving after something better, 
Christ has not forgotten thee, for thou hast not quite forgotten him. 
The believer cannot do without his Lord; words are inadequate to express 
his thoughts of him. We cannot live on the sands of the wilderness, 
we want the manna which drops from on high; our skin bottles of creature 
confidence cannot yield us a drop of moisture, but we drink of the 
rock which follows us, and that rock is Christ. When you feed on him 
your soul can sing, “He hath satisfied my mouth with good things, so that my youth is renewed

voice, “Depart, ye cursed; thou hast rejected me, and I reject thee; thou 
hast played the harlot, and departed from me: I also have banished 
thee forever from my presence, and will not have mercy upon thee.” What will be this wretch’s shame at the last great day when, before assembled multitudes, the 
apostate shall be unmasked? See the profane, and sinners who never 
professed religion, lifting themselves up from their beds of fire 
to point at him. “There he is,” says one, “will he preach the gospel in hell?” “There he is,” says another, “he rebuked me for cursing, and was a hypocrite himself!” “Aha!” says another, “here comes a psalm-singing Methodist—one who was always at his meeting; he is the man who boasted of his 
being sure of everlasting life; and here he is!” No greater eagerness will ever be seen among Satanic tormentors, 
than in that day when devils drag the hypocrite’s soul down to perdition. Bunyan pictures this with massive but awful 
grandeur of poetry when he speaks of the back-way to hell. Seven devils 
bound the wretch with nine cords, and dragged him from the road to 
heaven, in which he had professed to walk, and thrust him through 
the back-door into hell. Mind that back-way to hell, professors! “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.” Look well to your state; see whether you be in Christ or not. It 
is the easiest thing in the world to give a lenient verdict when oneself 
is to be tried; but O, be just and true here. Be just to all, but 
be rigorous to yourself. Remember if it be not a rock on which you 
build, when the house shall fall, great will be the fall of it. O 
may the Lord give you sincerity, constancy, and firmness; and in no 
day, however evil, may you be led to turn aside.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0626pm-p3">Vanish forever all thought of indulging the flesh if you would live 
in the power of your risen Lord. It were ill that a man who is alive 
in Christ should dwell in the corruption of sin. “Why seek ye the living among the dead?” said the angel to Magdalene. Should the living dwell in the sepulchre? 
Should divine life be immured in the charnel house of fleshly lust? 
How can we partake of the cup of the Lord and yet drink the cup of 
Belial? Surely, believer, from open lusts and sins you are delivered: 
have you also escaped from the more secret and delusive lime-twigs 
of the Satanic fowler? Have you come forth from the lust of pride? 
Have you escaped from slothfulness? Have you clean escaped from carnal 
security? Are you seeking day by day to live above worldliness, the 
pride of life, and the ensnaring vice of avarice? Remember, it is 
for this that you have been enriched with the treasures of God. If 
you be indeed the chosen of God, and beloved by him, do not suffer 
all the lavish treasure of grace to be wasted upon you. Follow after 
holiness; it is the Christian’s crown and glory. An unholy church! it is useless to the world, and 
of no esteem among men. It is an abomination, hell’s laughter, heaven’s abhorrence. The worst evils which have ever come upon the world 
have been brought upon her by an unholy church. O Christian, the vows 
of God are upon you. You are God’s priest: act as such. You are God’s king: reign over your lusts. You are God’s chosen: do not associate with Belial. Heaven is your portion: live 
like a heavenly spirit, so shall you prove that you have true faith 
in Jesus, for there cannot be faith in the heart unless there be holiness 
in the life.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0627am-p3">This is a crafty word from the lip of the arch-tyrant Pharaoh. If 
the poor bondaged Israelites must needs go out of Egypt, then he bargains 
with them that it shall not be very far away; not too far for them 
to escape the terror of his arms, and the observation of his spies. 
After the same fashion, the world loves not the non-conformity of 
nonconformity, or the dissidence of dissent; it would have us be more 
charitable and not carry matters with too severe a hand. Death to 
the world, and burial with Christ, are experiences which carnal minds 
treat with ridicule, and hence the ordinance which sets them forth 
is almost universally neglected, and even condemned. Worldly wisdom 
recommends the path of compromise, and talks of “moderation.” According to this carnal policy, purity is admitted to be very desirable, 
but we are warned against being too precise; truth is of course to 
be followed, but error is not to be severely denounced. “Yes,” says the world, “be spiritually minded by all means, but do not deny yourself a little 
gay society, an occasional ball, and a Christmas visit to a theatre. 
What’s the good of crying down a thing when it is so fashionable, and everybody 
does it?” Multitudes of professors yield to this cunning advice, to their own 
eternal ruin. If we would follow the Lord wholly, we must go right 
away into the wilderness of separation, and leave the Egypt of the 
carnal world behind us. We must leave its maxims, its pleasures, and 
its religion too, and go far away to the place where the Lord calls 
his sanctified ones. When the town is on fire, our house cannot be 
too far from the flames. When the plague is abroad, a man cannot be 
too far from its haunts. The further from a viper the better, and 
the further from worldly conformity the better. To all true believers 
let the trumpet-call be sounded, “Come ye out from among them, be ye separate.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0627pm-p3">Some persons have the foolish notion that the only way in which they 
can live for God is by becoming ministers, missionaries, or Bible 
women. Alas! how many would be shut out from any opportunity of magnifying 
the Most High if this were the case. Beloved, it is not office, it 
is earnestness; it is not position, it is grace which will enable 
us to glorify God. God is most surely glorified in that cobbler’s stall, where the godly worker, as he plies the awl, sings of the 
Saviour’s love, aye, glorified far more than in many a prebendal stall where 
official religiousness performs its scanty duties. The name of Jesus 
is glorified by the poor unlearned carter as he drives his horse, 
and blesses his God, or speaks to his fellow labourer by the roadside, 
as much as by the popular divine who, throughout the country, like 
Boanerges, is thundering out the gospel. God is glorified by our serving 
him in our proper vocations. Take care, dear reader, that you do not 
forsake the path of duty by leaving your occupation, and take care 
you do not dishonour your profession while in it. Think little of 
yourselves, but do not think too little of your callings. Every lawful 
trade may be sanctified by the gospel to noblest ends. Turn to the 
Bible, and you will find the most menial forms of labour connected 
either with most daring deeds of faith, or with persons whose lives 
have been illustrious for holiness. Therefore be not discontented 
with your calling. Whatever God has made your position, or your work, 
abide in that, unless you are quite sure that he calls you to something 
else. Let your first care be to glorify God to the utmost of your 
power where you are. Fill your present sphere to his praise, and if 
he needs you in another he will show it you. This evening lay aside 
vexatious ambition, and embrace peaceful content.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0628am-p3">It is ever the Holy Spirit’s work to turn our eyes away from self to Jesus; but Satan’s work is just the opposite of this, for he is constantly trying to 
make us regard ourselves instead of Christ. He insinuates, “Your sins are too great for pardon; you have no faith; you do not 
repent enough; you will never be able to continue to the end; you 
have not the joy of his children; you have such a wavering hold of 
Jesus.” All these are thoughts about self, and we shall never find comfort 
or assurance by looking within. But the Holy Spirit turns our eyes 
entirely away from self: he tells us that we are nothing, but that 
“Christ is all in all.” Remember, therefore, it is not <i>thy hold</i> of Christ that saves thee—it is Christ; it is not <i>thy joy</i> in Christ that saves thee—it is Christ; it is not even faith in Christ, though that be the instrument—it is Christ’s blood and merits; therefore, look not so much to thy hand with which 
thou art grasping Christ, as to Christ; look not to thy hope, but 
to Jesus, the source of thy hope; look not to thy faith, but to Jesus, 
the author and finisher of thy faith. We shall never find happiness 
by looking at our prayers, our doings, or our feelings; it is what 
<i>Jesus</i> is, not what we are, that gives rest to the soul. If we would at 
once overcome Satan and have peace with God, it must be by “looking unto Jesus.” Keep thine eye simply on him; let his death, his sufferings, his 
merits, his glories, his intercession, be fresh upon thy mind; when 
thou wakest in the morning look to him; when thou liest down at night 
look to him. Oh! let not thy hopes or fears come between thee and 
Jesus; follow hard after him, and he will never fail thee.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0628pm-p3">This incident is an instructive emblem of the sure victory of the 
divine handiwork over all opposition. Whenever a divine principle 
is cast into the heart, though the devil may fashion a counterfeit, 
and produce swarms of opponents, as sure as ever God is in the work, 
it will swallow up all its foes. If God’s grace takes possession of a man, the world’s magicians may throw down all their rods; and every rod may be as 
cunning and poisonous as a serpent, but Aaron’s rod will swallow up their rods. The sweet attractions of the cross 
will woo and win the man’s heart, and he who lived only for this deceitful earth will now have 
an eye for the upper spheres, and a wing to mount into celestial heights. 
When grace has won the day the worldling seeks the world to come. 
The same fact is to be observed in the life of the believer. What 
multitudes of foes has our faith had to meet! Our old sins—the devil threw them down before us, and they turned to serpents. 
What hosts of them! Ah, but the cross of Jesus destroys them all. 
Faith in Christ makes short work of all our sins. Then the devil has 
launched forth another host of serpents in the form of worldly trials, 
temptations, unbelief; but faith in Jesus is more than a match for 
them, and overcomes them all. The same absorbing principle shines 
in the faithful service of God! With an enthusiastic love for Jesus 
difficulties are surmounted, sacrifices become pleasures, sufferings 
are honours. But if religion is thus a consuming passion in the heart, 
then it follows that there are many persons who profess religion but 
have it not; for what they have will not bear this test. Examine yourself, 
my reader, on this point. Aaron’s rod <i>proved</i> its heaven-given power. Is your religion doing so? If Christ be anything 
he must be everything. O rest not till love and faith in Jesus be 
the master passions of your soul!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0629am-p3">Let us not imagine that <i>the soul</i> sleeps in insensibility. “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise,” is the whisper of Christ to every dying saint. They “sleep in Jesus,” but their souls are before the throne of God, praising him day and 
night in his temple, singing hallelujahs to him who washed them from 
their sins in his blood. The body sleeps in its lonely bed of earth, 
beneath the coverlet of grass. But what is this sleep? The idea connected 
with sleep is “<i>rest</i>,” and that is the thought which the Spirit of God would convey to us. 
Sleep makes each night a Sabbath for the day. Sleep shuts fast the 
door of the soul, and bids all intruders tarry for a while, that the 
life within may enter its summer garden of ease. The toil-worn believer 
quietly sleeps, as does the weary child when it slumbers on its mother’s breast. Oh! happy they who die in the Lord; they rest from their 
labours, and their works do follow them. Their quiet repose shall 
never be broken until God shall rouse them to give them their full 
reward. Guarded by angel watchers, curtained by eternal mysteries, 
they sleep on, the inheritors of glory, till the fulness of time shall 
bring the fulness of redemption. What an awaking shall be theirs! 
They were laid in their last resting place, weary and worn, but such 
they shall not rise. They went to their rest with the furrowed brow, 
and the wasted features, but they wake up in beauty and glory. The 
shrivelled seed, so destitute of form and comeliness, rises from the 
dust a beauteous flower. The winter of the grave gives way to the 
spring of redemption and the summer of glory. Blessed is death, since 
it, through the divine power, disrobes us of this work-day garment, 
to clothe us with the wedding garment of incorruption. Blessed are 
those who “sleep in Jesus.”</p>

his carnal security, the grace of God was for a time, in its more 
active operations, withdrawn. Here is quite enough to account with 
the Babylonians; for if the grace of God should leave the best Christian, 
there is enough of sin in his heart to make him the worst of transgressors. 
If left to yourselves, you who are warmest for Christ would cool down

universe of angels rich beyond all thought, yet was he not content 
until he had given us all that he had. It would have been surprising 
grace if he had allowed us to eat the crumbs of his bounty beneath 
the table of his mercy; but he will do nothing by halves, he makes 
us sit with him and share the feast. Had he given us some small pension 
from his royal coffers, we should have had cause to love him eternally; 
but no, he will have his bride as rich as himself, and he will not 
have a glory or a grace in which she shall not share. He has not been 
content with less than making us joint-heirs with himself, so that 
we might have equal possessions. He has emptied all his estate into 
the coffers of the Church, and hath all things common with his redeemed. 
There is not one room in his house the key of which he will withhold 
from his people. He gives them full liberty to take all that he hath 
to be their own; he loves them to make free with his treasure, and 
appropriate as much as they can possibly carry. The boundless fulness 
of his all-sufficiency is as free to the believer as the air he breathes. 
Christ hath put the flagon of his love and grace to the believer’s lip, and bidden him drink on forever; for could he drain it, he 
is welcome to do so, and as he cannot exhaust it, he is bidden to 
drink abundantly, for it is all his own. What truer proof of fellowship

<p class="normal" id="d0630pm-p3">At the very time when the Chaldeans surrounded Jerusalem, and when 
the sword, famine and pestilence had desolated the land, Jeremiah 
was commanded by God to purchase a field, and have the deed of transfer 
legally sealed and witnessed. This was a strange purchase for a rational 
man to make. Prudence could not justify it, for it was buying with 
scarcely a probability that the person purchasing could ever enjoy 
the possession. But it was enough for Jeremiah that his God had bidden 
him, for well he knew that God will be justified of all his children. 
He reasoned thus: “Ah, Lord God! thou canst make this plot of ground of use to me; thou 
canst rid this land of these oppressors; thou canst make me yet sit 
under my vine and my fig-tree in the heritage which I have bought; 
for thou didst make the heavens and the earth, and there is nothing 
too hard for thee.” This gave a majesty to the early saints, that they dared to do at 
God’s command things which carnal reason would condemn. Whether it be 
a Noah who is to build a ship on dry land, an Abraham who is to offer 
up his only son, or a Moses who is to despise the treasures of Egypt, 
or a Joshua who is to besiege Jericho seven days, using no weapons 
but the blasts of rams’ horns, they all act upon God’s command, contrary to the dictates of carnal reason; and the Lord 
gives them a rich reward as the result of their obedient faith. Would 
to God we had in the religion of these modern times a more potent 
infusion of this heroic faith in God. If we would venture more upon 
the naked promise of God, we should enter a world of wonders to which 
as yet we are strangers. Let Jeremiah’s place of confidence be ours—nothing is too hard for the God that created the heavens and the earth.</p>

that thou art spared to testify of the faithfulness of the Lord. The 
seasons change and thou changest, but thy Lord abides evermore the

summer and in winter it pours forth its flood. The upper springs are 
never scanty, and blessed be the name of the Lord, the nether springs

the same God of providence. Job said his brethren were like deceitful

The Nile is the great confidence of Egypt, but its floods are variable; 
our Lord is evermore the same. By turning the course of the Euphrates, 
Cyrus took the city of Babylon, but no power, human or infernal, can

thee when thou art prepared to hear. If there be any slowness to commune 
it is not on his part, but altogether on thine own, for he stands 
at the door and knocks, and if his people will but open he rejoices 
to enter. But in what state is my heart, which is my Lord’s garden? May I venture to hope that it is well trimmed and watered,

heareth! O that he would walk with me; I am ready to give up my whole 
heart and mind to him, and every other thought is hushed. I am only 
asking what he delights to give. I am sure that he will condescend 
to have fellowship with me, for he has given me his Holy Spirit to 
abide with me forever. Sweet is the cool twilight, when every star

celestial love. My Father, my elder Brother, my sweet Comforter, speak 
now in lovingkindness, for thou hast opened mine ear and I am not

<p class="normal" id="d0702am-p3">Blessed is the fact that Christians can rejoice even in the deepest 
distress; although trouble may surround them, they still sing; and, 
like many birds, they sing best in their cages. The waves may roll 
over them, but their souls soon rise to the surface and see the light 
of God’s countenance; they have a buoyancy about them which keeps their head 
always above the water, and helps them to sing amid the tempest, “God is with me still.” To whom shall the glory be given? Oh! to Jesus—it is all by Jesus. Trouble does not necessarily bring consolation 
with it to the believer, but the presence of the Son of God in the 
fiery furnace with him fills his heart with joy. He is sick and suffering, 
but Jesus visits him and makes his bed for him. He is dying, and the 
cold chilly waters of Jordan are gathering about him up to the neck, 
but Jesus puts His arms around him, and cries, “Fear not, beloved; to die is to be blessed; the waters of death have 
their fountain-head in heaven; they are not bitter, they are sweet 
as nectar, for they flow from the throne of God.” As the departing saint wades through the stream, and the billows 
gather around him, and heart and flesh fail him, the same voice sounds 
in his ears, “Fear not; I am with thee; be not dismayed; I am thy God.” As he nears the borders of the infinite unknown, and is almost affrighted 
to enter the realm of shades, Jesus says, “Fear not, it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Thus strengthened and consoled, the believer is not afraid to die; 
nay, he is even willing to depart, for since he has seen Jesus as 
the morning star, he longs to gaze upon Him as the sun in his strength. 
Truly, the presence of Jesus is all the heaven we desire. He is at 
once</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0702pm-p3">A cry is the natural expression of sorrow, and a suitable utterance 
when all other modes of appeal fail us; but the cry must be alone 
directed to the Lord, for to cry to man is to waste our entreaties 
upon the air. When we consider the readiness of the Lord to hear, 
and his ability to aid, we shall see good reason for directing all 
our appeals at once to the God of our salvation. It will be in vain 
to call to the rocks in the day of judgment, but our Rock attends 
to our cries.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0702pm-p4">“<i>Be not silent to me</i>.” Mere formalists may be content without answers to their prayers, 
but genuine suppliants cannot; they are not satisfied with the results 
of prayer itself in calming the mind and subduing the will—they must go further, and obtain actual replies from heaven, or they 
cannot rest; and those replies they long to receive at once, they 
dread even a little of God’s silence. God’s voice is often so terrible that it shakes the wilderness; but his 
silence is equally full of awe to an eager suppliant. When God seems 
to close his ear, we must not therefore close our mouths, but rather 
cry with more earnestness; for when our note grows shrill with eagerness 
and grief, he will not long deny us a hearing. What a dreadful case 
should we be in if the Lord should become forever silent to our prayers? 
“<i>Lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them</i> <i>that go down into the pit</i>.” Deprived of the God who answers prayer, we should be in a more pitiable 
plight than the dead in the grave, and should soon sink to the same 
level as the lost in hell. We <i>must</i> have answers to prayer: ours is an urgent case of dire necessity; 
surely the Lord will speak peace to our agitated minds, for he never 
can find it in his heart to permit his own elect to perish.</p>

have ruinously destroyed all that I had achieved in times of zealous 
industry; my seasons of coldness have frozen all the genial glow of 
my periods of fervency and enthusiasm; and my fits of worldliness 
have thrown me back from my advances in the divine life. I had need 
to beware of lean prayers, lean praises, lean duties, and lean experiences, 
for these will eat up the fat of my comfort and peace. If I neglect 
prayer for never so short a time, I lose all the spirituality to which 
I had attained; if I draw no fresh supplies from heaven, the old corn 
in my granary is soon consumed by the famine which rages in my soul. 
When the caterpillars of indifference, the cankerworms of worldliness, 
and the palmerworms of self-indulgence, lay my heart completely desolate, 
and make my soul to languish, all my former fruitfulness and growth 
in grace avails me nothing whatever. How anxious should I be to have 
no lean-fleshed days, no ill-favoured hours! If every day I journeyed 
towards the goal of my desires I should soon reach it, but backsliding 
leaves me still far off from the prize of my high calling, and robs 
me of the advances which I had so laboriously made. The only way in 
which all my days can be as the “fat kine,” is to feed them in the right meadow, to spend them with the Lord, 
in His service, in His company, in His fear, and in His way. Why should 
not every year be richer than the past, in love, and usefulness, and 
joy?—I am nearer the celestial hills, I have had more experience of my 
Lord, and should be more like Him. O Lord, keep far from me the curse 
of leanness of soul; let me not have to cry, “My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me!” but may I be well-fed and nourished in thy house, that I may praise 
thy name.</p>

you may have to mourn over on earth, you are not “suffering with Christ,” and have no hope of reigning with him in heaven. Neither are we to 
conclude that all a Christian’s sufferings are sufferings with Christ, for <i>it is essential that he be called by God to</i> <i>suffer</i>. If we are rash and imprudent, and run into positions for which neither 
providence nor grace has fitted us, we ought to question whether we 
are not rather sinning than communing with Jesus. If we let passion 
take the place of judgment, and self-will reign instead of Scriptural 
authority, we shall fight the Lord’s battles with the devil’s weapons, and if we cut our own fingers we must not be surprised. 
Again, <i>in troubles which</i> <i>come upon us as the result of sin, we must not dream that we are</i> <i>suffering with Christ</i>. When Miriam spoke evil of Moses, and the leprosy polluted her, she 
was not suffering for God. Moreover, suffering which God accepts <i>must have God’s glory as</i> <i>its end</i>. If I suffer that I may earn a name, or win applause, I shall get 
no other reward than that of the Pharisee. It is requisite also <i>that love to Jesus, and love to his</i> <i>elect, be ever the mainspring of all our patience. We must</i> <i>manifest the Spirit of Christ</i> in meekness, gentleness, and forgiveness. Let us search and see if 
we truly <i>suffer with</i> <i>Jesus</i>. And if we do thus suffer, what is our “light affliction” compared with <i>reigning with him</i>? Oh it is so blessed to be in the furnace with Christ, and such an 
honour to stand in the pillory with him, that if there were no future 
reward, we might count ourselves happy in present honour; but when 
the recompense is so eternal, so infinitely more than we had any right 
to expect, shall we not take up the cross with alacrity, and go on 
our way rejoicing?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0704am-p3">Sanctification begins in regeneration. The Spirit of God infuses into 
man that new living principle by which he becomes “a new creature” in Christ Jesus. This work, which begins in the new birth, is carried 
on in two ways—mortification, whereby the lusts of the flesh are subdued and kept 
under; and vivification, by which the life which God has put within 
us is made to be a well of water springing up unto everlasting life. 
This is carried on every day in what is called “perseverance,” by which the Christian is preserved and continued in a gracious state, 
and is made to abound in good works unto the praise and glory of God; 
and it culminates or comes to perfection, in “glory,” when the soul, being thoroughly purged, is caught up to dwell with 
holy beings at the right hand of the Majesty on high. But while the 
Spirit of God is thus the author of sanctification, yet there is a 
visible agency employed which must not be forgotten. “Sanctify them,” said Jesus, “through thy <i>truth</i>: thy word is truth.” The passages of Scripture which prove that the instrument of our 
sanctification is the Word of God are very many. The Spirit of God 
brings to our minds the precepts and doctrines of truth, and applies 
them with power. These are heard in the ear, and being received in 
the heart, they work in us to will and to do of God’s good pleasure. The truth is the sanctifier, and if we do not hear 
or read the truth, we shall not grow in sanctification. We only progress 
in sound living as we progress in sound understanding. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.” Do not say of any error, “It is a mere matter of opinion.” No man indulges an error of judgment, without sooner or later tolerating 
an error in practice. Hold fast the truth, for by so holding the truth 
shall you be sanctified by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0704pm-p3">Outward practical holiness is a very precious mark of grace. It is 
to be feared that many professors have perverted the doctrine of justification 
by faith in such a way as to treat good works with contempt; if so, 
they will receive everlasting contempt at the last great day. If our 
hands are not clean, let us wash them in Jesus’ precious blood, and so let us lift up pure hands unto God. But “<i>clean hands</i>” will not suffice, unless they are connected with “<i>a pure heart</i>.” True religion is heart-work. We may wash the outside of the cup and 
the platter as long as we please, but if the inward parts be filthy, 
we are filthy altogether in the sight of God, for our hearts are more 
truly ourselves than our hands are; the very life of our being lies 
in the inner nature, and hence the imperative need of purity within. 
The pure in heart shall see God, all others are but blind bats.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0704pm-p4">The man who is born for heaven “<i>hath not lifted up his soul</i> <i>unto vanity</i>.” All men have their joys, by which their souls are lifted up; the 
worldling lifts up his soul in carnal delights, which are mere empty 
vanities; but the saint loves more substantial things; like Jehoshaphat, 
he is lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He who is content with husks, 
will be reckoned with the swine. Does the world satisfy thee? Then 
thou hast thy reward and portion in this life; make much of it, for 
thou shalt know no other joy.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0704pm-p5">“<i>Nor sworn deceitfully</i>.” The saints are men of honour still. The Christian man’s word is his only oath; but that is as good as twenty oaths of other 
men. False speaking will shut any man out of heaven, for a liar shall 
not enter into God’s house, whatever may be his professions or doings. Reader, does the 
text before us condemn thee, or dost thou hope to ascend into the 
hill of the Lord?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0705am-p3">We are very apt to regard the apostolic saints as if they were “saints” in a more especial manner than the other children of God. All are 
“saints” whom God has called by His grace, and sanctified by His Spirit; but 
we are apt to look upon the <i>apostles</i> as extraordinary beings, scarcely subject to the same weaknesses 
and temptations as ourselves. Yet in so doing we are forgetful of 
this truth, that the nearer a man lives to God the more intensely 
has he to mourn over his own evil heart; and the more his Master honours 
him in his service, the more also doth the evil of the flesh vex and 
tease him day by day. The fact is, if we had seen the apostle Paul, 
we should have thought him remarkably like the rest of the chosen 
family: and if we had talked with him, we should have said, “We find that his experience and ours are much the same. He is more 
faithful, more holy, and more deeply taught than we are, but he has 
the selfsame trials to endure. Nay, in some respects he is more sorely 
tried than ourselves.” Do not, then, look upon the ancient saints as being exempt either 
from infirmities or sins; and do not regard them with that mystic 
reverence which will almost make us idolaters. Their holiness is attainable 
even by us. We are “called to be saints” by that same voice which constrained them to their high vocation. 
It is a Christian’s duty to force his way into the inner circle of saintship; and if 
these saints were superior to us in their attainments, as they certainly 
were, let us follow them; let us emulate their ardour and holiness. 
We have the same light that they had, the same grace is accessible 
to us, and why should we rest satisfied until we have equalled them 
in heavenly character? They lived <i>with</i> Jesus, they lived <i>for</i> Jesus, therefore they grew <i>like</i> Jesus. Let us live by the same Spirit as they did, “looking unto Jesus,” and our saintship will soon be apparent.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0705pm-p3">Seeing that we have such a God to trust to, let us rest upon him with 
all our weight; let us resolutely drive out all unbelief, and endeavour 
to get rid of doubts and fears, which so much mar our comfort; since 
there is no excuse for fear where God is the foundation of our trust. 
A loving parent would be sorely grieved if his child could not trust 
him; and how ungenerous, how unkind is our conduct when we put so 
little confidence in our heavenly Father who has never failed us, 
and who never will. It were well if doubting were banished from the 
household of God; but it is to be feared that old Unbelief is as nimble 
nowadays as when the psalmist asked, “Is his mercy clean gone forever? Will he be favourable no more?” David had not made any very lengthy trial of the mighty sword of 
the giant Goliath, and yet he said, “There is none like it.” He had tried it once in the hour of his youthful victory, and it 
had proved itself to be of the right metal, and therefore he praised 
it ever afterwards; even so should we speak well of our God, there 
is none like unto him in the heaven above or the earth beneath; “To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy 
One.” There is no rock like unto the rock of Jacob, our enemies themselves 
being judges. So far from suffering doubts to live in our hearts, 
we will take the whole detestable crew, as Elijah did the prophets 
of Baal, and slay them over the brook; and for a stream to kill them 
at, we will select the sacred torrent which wells forth from our Saviour’s wounded side. We have been in many trials, but we have never yet 
been cast where we could not find in our God all that we needed. Let 
us then be encouraged to trust in the Lord forever, assured that his 
ever lasting strength will be, as it has been, our succour and stay.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0706am-p3">Divine love is rendered conspicuous when it shines in the midst of 
judgments. Fair is that lone star which smiles through the rifts of 
the thunder clouds; bright is the oasis which blooms in the wilderness 
of sand; so fair and so bright is love in the midst of wrath. When 
the Israelites provoked the Most High by their continued idolatry, 
he punished them by withholding both dew and rain, so that their land 
was visited by a sore famine; but while he did this, he took care 
that his own chosen ones should be secure. If all other brooks are 
dry, yet shall there be one reserved for Elijah; and when that fails, 
God shall still preserve for him a place of sustenance; nay, not only 
so, the Lord had not simply one “Elijah,” but he had a remnant according to the election of grace, who were 
hidden by fifties in a cave, and though the whole land was subject 
to famine, yet these fifties in the cave were fed, and fed from Ahab’s table too by His faithful, God-fearing steward, Obadiah. Let us 
from this draw the inference, that come what may, God’s people are safe. Let convulsions shake the solid earth, let the 
skies themselves be rent in twain, yet amid the wreck of worlds the 
believer shall be as secure as in the calmest hour of rest. If God 
cannot save his people <i>under</i> heaven, he will save them <i>in</i> heaven. If the world becomes too hot to hold them, then heaven shall 
be the place of their reception and their safety. Be ye then confident, 
when ye hear of wars, and rumours of wars. Let no agitation distress 
you, but be quiet from fear of evil. Whatsoever cometh upon the earth, 
you, beneath the broad wings of Jehovah, shall be secure. Stay yourself 
upon his promise; rest in his faithfulness, and bid defiance to the 
blackest future, for there is nothing in it direful for you. Your 
sole concern should be to show forth to the world the blessedness 
of hearkening to the voice of wisdom.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0706pm-p3">Have you ever really weighed and considered how great the sin of God’s people is? Think how heinous is your own transgression, and you 
will find that not only does a sin here and there tower up like an 
alp, but that your iniquities are heaped upon each other, as in the 
old fable of the giants who piled Pelion upon Ossa, mountain upon 
mountain. What an aggregate of sin there is in the life of one of 
the most sanctified of God’s children! Attempt to multiply this, the sin of one only, by the 
multitude of the redeemed, “a number which no man can number,” and you will have some conception of the great mass of the guilt 
of the people for whom Jesus shed his blood. But we arrive at a more 
adequate idea of the magnitude of sin by the greatness of the remedy 
provided. It is the blood of Jesus Christ, God’s only and well-beloved Son. God’s Son! Angels cast their crowns before him! All the choral symphonies 
of heaven surround his glorious throne. “God over all, blessed forever. Amen.” And yet he takes upon himself the form of a servant, and is scourged 
and pierced, bruised and torn, and at last slain; since nothing but 
the blood of the incarnate Son of God could make atonement for our 
offences. No human mind can adequately estimate the infinite value 
of the divine sacrifice, for great as is the sin of God’s people, the atonement which takes it away is immeasurably greater. 
Therefore, the believer, even when sin rolls like a black flood, and 
the remembrance of the past is bitter, can yet stand before the blazing 
throne of the great and holy God, and cry, “Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea rather, that 
hath risen again.” While the recollection of his sin fills him with shame and sorrow, 
he at the same time makes it a foil to show the brightness of mercy—guilt is the dark night in which the fair star of divine love shines 
with serene splendour.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0707am-p3">This one morning in the year we reserved to refresh the reader’s memory upon the subject of prayer for ministers, and we do most 
earnestly implore every Christian household to grant the fervent request 
of the text first uttered by an apostle and now repeated by us. Brethren, 
our work is solemnly momentous, involving weal or woe to thousands; 
we treat with souls for God on eternal business, and our word is either 
a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death. A very heavy responsibility 
rests upon us, and it will be no small mercy if at the last we be 
found clear of the blood of all men. As officers in Christ’s army, we are the especial mark of the enmity of men and devils; 
they watch for our halting, and labour to take us by the heels. Our 
sacred calling involves us in temptations from which you are exempt, 
above all it too often draws us away from our personal enjoyment of 
truth into a ministerial and official consideration of it. We meet 
with many knotty cases, and our wits are at a non plus; we observe 
very sad backslidings, and our hearts are wounded; we see millions 
perishing, and our spirits sink. We wish to profit you by our preaching; 
we desire to be blest to your children; we long to be useful both 
to saints and sinners; therefore, dear friends, intercede for us with 
our God. Miserable men are we if we miss the aid of your prayers, 
but happy are we if we live in your supplications. You do not look 
to us but to our Master for spiritual blessings, and yet how many 
times has He given those blessings through His ministers; ask then, 
again and again, that we may be the earthen vessels into which the 
Lord may put the treasure of the gospel. We, the whole company of 
missionaries, ministers, city missionaries, and students, do in the 
name of Jesus beseech you</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0707pm-p3">Saved one, consider gratefully this mandate of mercy. Note that this 
fiat of God is <i>majestic</i>. In our text, we perceive a sinner with nothing in him but sin, expecting 
nothing but wrath; but the eternal Lord passes by in his glory; he 
looks, he pauses, and he pronounces the solitary but royal word, “Live.” There speaks a God. Who but he could venture thus to deal with life 
and dispense it with a single syllable? Again, this fiat is <i>manifold</i>. When he saith “Live,” it includes many things. Here is judicial life. The sinner is ready 
to be condemned, but the mighty One saith, “Live,” and he rises pardoned and absolved. It is spiritual life. We knew 
not Jesus—our eyes could not see Christ, our ears could not hear his voice—Jehovah said “Live,” and we were quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. Moreover, 
it includes glory-life, which is the perfection of spiritual life. 
“I said unto thee, Live:” and that word rolls on through all the years of time till death comes, 
and in the midst of the shadows of death, the Lord’s voice is still heard, “Live!” In the morning of the resurrection it is that self-same voice which 
is echoed by the arch-angel, “Live,” and as holy spirits rise to heaven to be blest forever in the glory 
of their God, it is in the power of this same word, “Live.” Note again, that it is an <i>irresistible</i> mandate. Saul of Tarsus is on the road to Damascus to arrest the 
saints of the living God. A voice is heard from heaven and a light 
is seen above the brightness of the sun, and Saul is crying out, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” This mandate is a mandate of <i>free grace</i>. When sinners are saved, it is only and solely because God <i>will</i> do it to magnify his free, unpurchased, unsought grace. Christians, 
see your position, debtors to grace; show your gratitude by earnest, 
Christlike lives, and as God has bidden you live, see to it that you 
live in earnest.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0708am-p3">Where lies the secret strength of faith? It lies in the food it feeds 
on; for faith studies what the promise is—an emanation of divine grace, an overflowing of the great heart of 
God; and faith says, “My God could not have given this promise, except from love and grace; 
therefore it is quite certain his Word will be fulfilled.” Then faith thinketh, “<i>Who gave</i> this promise?” It considereth not so much its greatness, as, “Who is the author of it?” She remembers that it is God who cannot lie—God omnipotent, God immutable; and therefore concludeth that the promise 
must be fulfilled; and forward she advances in this firm conviction. 
She remembereth,<i>why the promise was given</i>,—namely, for God’s glory, and she feels perfectly sure that God’s glory is safe, that he will never stain his own escutcheon, nor 
mar the lustre of his own crown; and therefore the promise must and 
will stand. Then faith also considereth the amazing <i>work</i> <i>of Christ</i> as being a clear proof of the Father’s intention to fulfil his word. “He that spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for us 
all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?” Moreover faith looks back upon <i>the</i> <i>past</i>, for her battles have strengthened her, and her victories have given 
her courage. She remembers that God never has failed her; nay, that 
he never did once fail any of his children. She recollecteth times 
of great peril, when deliverance came; hours of awful need, when as 
her day her strength was found, and she cries, “No, I never will be led to think that he can change and leave his 
servant now. Hitherto the Lord hath helped me, and he will help me 
still.” Thus faith views each promise in its connection with the promise-giver, 
and, because she does so, can with assurance say, “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life!”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0708pm-p3">When the believer has begun with trembling feet to walk in the way 
of the Lord, he asks to be still led onward like a little child upheld 
by its parent’s helping hand, and he craves to be further instructed in the alphabet 
of truth. Experimental teaching is the burden of this prayer. David 
knew much, but he felt his ignorance, and desired to be still in the 
Lord’s school: four times over in two verses he applies for a scholarship 
in the college of grace. It were well for many professors if instead 
of following their own devices, and cutting out new paths of thought 
for themselves, they would enquire for the good old ways of God’s own truth, and beseech the Holy Ghost to give them sanctified understandings 
and teachable spirits. “<i>For thou art the God of my salvation</i>.” The Three-One Jehovah is the Author and Perfecter of salvation to 
his people. Reader, is he the God of <i>your</i> salvation? Do you find in the Father’s election, in the Son’s atonement, and in the Spirit’s quickening, all the grounds of your eternal hopes? If so, you may 
use this as an argument for obtaining further blessings; if the Lord 
has ordained to save you, surely he will not refuse to instruct you 
in his ways. It is a happy thing when we can address the Lord with 
the confidence which David here manifests, it gives us great power 
in prayer, and comfort in trial. “<i>On thee do I wait all the day</i>.” Patience is the fair handmaid and daughter of faith; we cheerfully 
wait when we are certain that we shall not wait in vain. It is our 
duty and our privilege to wait upon the Lord in service, in worship, 
in expectancy, in trust all the days of our life. Our faith will be 
tried faith, and if it be of the true kind, it will bear continued 
trial without yielding. We shall not grow weary of waiting upon God 
if we remember how long and how graciously he once waited for us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0709am-p3">It is a delightful and profitable occupation to mark the hand of God 
in the lives of ancient saints, and to observe his goodness in delivering 
them, his mercy in pardoning them, and his faithfulness in keeping 
his covenant with them. But would it not be even more interesting 
and profitable for us to remark the hand of God in our own lives? 
Ought we not to look upon our own history as being at least as full 
of God, as full of his goodness and of his truth, as much a proof 
of his faithfulness and veracity, as the lives of any of the saints 
who have gone before? We do our Lord an injustice when we suppose 
that he wrought all his mighty acts, and showed himself strong for 
those in the early time, but doth not perform wonders or lay bare 
his arm for the saints who are now upon the earth. Let us review our 
own lives. Surely in these we may discover some happy incidents, refreshing 
to ourselves and glorifying to our God. Have you had no <i>deliverances</i>? Have you passed through no rivers, supported by the divine presence? 
Have you walked through no fires unharmed? Have you had no <i>manifestations</i>? Have you had no <i>choice favours</i>? The God who gave Solomon the desire of his heart, hath he never 
listened to you and answered your requests? That God of lavish bounty 
of whom David sang, “Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things,” hath he never satiated <i>you</i> with fatness? Have you never been made to lie down in green pastures? 
Have you never been led by the still waters? Surely the goodness of 
God has been the same to us as to the saints of old. Let us, then, 
weave his mercies into a song. Let us take the pure gold of thankfulness, 
and the jewels of praise and make them into another crown for the 
head of Jesus. Let our souls give forth music as sweet and as exhilarating 
as came from David’s harp, while we praise the Lord whose mercy endureth forever.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0709pm-p3">A believer has two principles at work within him. In his natural estate 
he was subject to one principle only, which was darkness; now light 
has entered, and the two principles disagree. Mark the apostle Paul’s words in the seventh chapter of Romans: “I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with 
me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see 
another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and 
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members.” How is this state of things occasioned? “The Lord divided the light from the darkness.” Darkness, by itself, is quiet and undisturbed, but when the Lord 
sends in light, there is a conflict, for the one is in opposition 
to the other: a conflict which will never cease till the believer 
is altogether light in the Lord. If there be a division <i>within</i> the individual Christian, there is certain to be <i>a division without</i>. So soon as the Lord gives to any man light, he proceeds to separate 
himself from the darkness around; he secedes from a merely worldly 
religion of outward ceremonial, for nothing short of the gospel of 
Christ will now satisfy him, and he withdraws himself from worldly 
society and frivolous amusements, and seeks the company of the saints, 
for “We know we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.” The light gathers to itself, and the darkness to itself. What God 
has divided, let us never try to unite, but as Christ went without 
the camp, bearing his reproach, so let us come out from the ungodly, 
and be a peculiar people. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate 
from sinners; and, as he was, so we are to be nonconformists to the 
world, dissenting from all sin, and distinguished from the rest of 
mankind by our likeness to our Master.</p>

is, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” The proclamations issued from the throne of glory are freely received 
by us: the decrees of the Great King we cheerfully obey. Then as citizens 
of the New Jerusalem, <i>we share heaven’s honours</i>. The glory which belongs to beatified saints belongs to us, for we 
are already sons of God, already princes of the blood imperial; already 
we wear the spotless robe of Jesus’ righteousness; already we have angels for our servitors, saints for 
our companions, Christ for our Brother, God for our Father, and a 
crown of immortality for our reward. We share the honours of citizenship, 
for we have come to the general assembly and Church of the first-born 
whose names are written in heaven. As citizens, we have <i>common</i> <i>rights to all the property of heaven</i>. Ours are its gates of pearl and walls of chrysolite; ours the azure 
light of the city that needs no candle nor light of the sun; ours 
the river of the water of life, and the twelve manner of fruits which 
grow on the trees planted on the banks thereof; there is nought in 
heaven that belongeth not to us. “Things present, or things to come,” all are ours. Also as citizens of heaven we <i>enjoy its</i> <i>delights</i>. Do they there rejoice over sinners that repent—prodigals that have returned? So do we. Do they chant the glories 
of triumphant grace? We do the same. Do they cast their crowns at 
Jesus’ feet? Such honours as we have we cast there too. Are they charmed 
with his smile? It is not less sweet to us who dwell below. Do they 
look forward, waiting for his second advent? We also look and long 
for his appearing. If, then, we are thus <i>citizens of heaven</i>, let our walk and actions be consistent with our high dignity.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0710pm-p3">The evening was “darkness” and the morning was “light,” and yet <i>the two together are called by the name that is given to</i> <i>the light alone</i>! This is somewhat remarkable, but it has an exact analogy in spiritual 
experience. In every believer there is darkness and light, and yet 
he is not to be named a sinner because there is sin in him, but he 
is to be named a saint because he possesses some degree of holiness. 
This will be a most comforting thought to those who are mourning their 
infirmities, and who ask, “Can I be a child of God while there is so much darkness in me?” Yes; for you, like the day, take not your name from the evening, 
but from the morning; and you are spoken of in the word of God as 
if you were even now perfectly holy as you will be soon. You are called 
the child of light, though there is darkness in you still. You are 
named after what is the predominating quality in the sight of God, 
which will one day be the only principle remaining. Observe that <i>the evening</i> <i>comes first</i>. Naturally we are darkness first in order of time, and the gloom 
is often first in our mournful apprehension, driving us to cry out 
in deep humiliation, “God be merciful to me, a sinner.” The place of the morning is second, it dawns when grace overcomes 
nature. It is a blessed aphorism of John Bunyan, “That which is last, lasts forever.” That which is first, yields in due season to the last; but nothing 
comes after the last. So that though you are naturally darkness, when 
once you become light in the Lord, there is no evening to follow; 
“thy sun shall no more go down.” The first day in this life is an evening and a morning; but the second 
day, when we shall be with God, forever, shall be a day with no evening, 
but one, sacred, high, eternal noon.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0711am-p3">You have seen the arch of heaven as it spans the plain: glorious are 
its colours, and rare its hues. It is beautiful, but, alas, it passes away, and lo, it is not. The fair colours 
give way to the fleecy clouds, and the sky is no longer brilliant 
with the tints of heaven. It is not <i>established</i>. How can it be? A glorious show made up of transitory sun-beams and 
passing rain-drops, how can it abide? The graces of the Christian 
character must not resemble the rainbow in its transitory beauty, 
but, on the contrary, must be stablished, settled, abiding. Seek, 
O believer, that every good thing you have may be an abiding thing. 
May your character not be a writing upon the sand, but an inscription 
upon the rock! May your faith be no “baseless fabric of a vision,” but may it be builded of material able to endure that awful fire 
which shall consume the wood, hay, and stubble of the hypocrite. May 
you be rooted and grounded in love. May your convictions be deep, 
your love real, your desires earnest. May your whole life be so settled 
and established, that all the blasts of hell, and all the storms of 
earth shall never be able to remove you. But notice how this blessing 
of being “stablished in the faith” is gained. The apostle’s words point us to <i>suffering</i> as the means employed—“<i>After that ye have suffered awhile</i>.” It is of no use to hope that we shall be well rooted if no rough 
winds pass over us. Those old gnarlings on the root of the oak tree, 
and those strange twistings of the branches, all tell of the many 
storms that have swept over it, and they are also indicators of the 
depth into which the roots have forced their way. So the Christian 
is made strong, and firmly rooted by all the trials and storms of 
life. Shrink not then from the tempestuous winds of trial, but take 
comfort, believing that by their rough discipline God is fulfilling 
this benediction to you.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0711pm-p3">In this simple way, by God’s grace, a living testimony for truth is always to be kept alive in 
the land—the beloved of the Lord are to hand down their witness for the gospel, 
and the covenant to their heirs, and these again to their next descendants. 
This is our <i>first</i> duty, we are to begin at the family hearth: he is a bad preacher 
who does not commence his ministry at home. The heathen are to be 
sought by all means, and the highways and hedges are to be searched, 
but home has a prior claim, and woe unto those who reverse the order 
of the Lord’s arrangements. To teach our children is a <i>personal</i> duty; we cannot delegate it to Sunday school teachers, or other friendly 
aids; these can assist us, but cannot deliver us from the sacred obligation; 
proxies and sponsors are wicked devices in this case: mothers and 
fathers must, like Abraham, command their households in the fear of 
God, and talk with their offspring concerning the wondrous works of 
the Most High. Parental teaching is a <i>natural</i> duty—who so fit to look to the child’s well-being as those who are the authors of his actual being? To 
neglect the instruction of our offspring is worse than brutish. Family 
religion is <i>necessary</i> for the nation, for the family itself, and for the church of God. 
By a thousand plots Popery is covertly advancing in our land, and 
one of the most effectual means for resisting its inroads is left 
almost neglected, namely, the instruction of children in the faith. 
Would that parents would awaken to a sense of the importance of this 
matter. It is a pleasant duty to talk of Jesus to our sons and daughters, 
and the more so because it has often proved to be an <i>accepted</i> work, for God has saved the children through the parents’ prayers and admonitions. May every house into which this volume shall 
come honour the Lord and receive his smile.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0712am-p4">Mark the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their gracious acts. 
How unwisely do those believers talk who make preferences in the Persons 
of the Trinity; who think of Jesus as if he were the embodiment of 
everything lovely and gracious, while the Father they regard as severely 
just, but destitute of kindness. Equally wrong are those who magnify 
the decree of the Father, and the atonement of the Son, so as to depreciate 
the work of the Spirit. In deeds of grace none of the Persons of the 
Trinity act apart from the rest. They are as united in their deeds 
as in their essence. In their love towards the chosen they are one, 
and in the actions which flow from that great central source they 
are still undivided. Specially notice this in the matter of sanctification. 
While we may without mistake speak of sanctification as the work of 
the Spirit, yet we must take heed that we do not view it as if the 
Father and the Son had no part therein. It is correct to speak of 
sanctification as the work of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. 
Still doth Jehovah say, “Let <i>us</i> make man in our own image after our likeness,” and thus we are “<i>his</i> workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath 
before ordained that we should walk in them.” See the value which God sets upon real holiness, since the Three 
Persons in the Trinity are represented as co-working to produce a 
Church without “spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.” And you, believer, as the follower of Christ, must also set a high 
value on holiness—upon purity of life and godliness of conversation. Value the blood 
of Christ as the foundation of your hope, but never speak disparagingly 
of the work of the Spirit which is your meetness for the inheritance 
of the saints in light. This day let us so live as to manifest the 
work of the Triune God in us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0713am-p3">Anger is not always or necessarily sinful, but it has such a tendency 
to run wild that whenever it displays itself, we should be quick to 
question its character, with this enquiry, “Doest thou well to be angry?” It may be that we can answer, “YES.” Very frequently anger is the madman’s firebrand, but sometimes it is Elijah’s fire from heaven. We do well when we are angry with sin, because 
of the wrong which it commits against our good and gracious God; or 
with ourselves because we remain so foolish after so much divine instruction; 
or with others when the sole cause of anger is the evil which they 
do. He who is not angry at transgression becomes a partaker in it. 
Sin is a loathsome and hateful thing, and no renewed heart can patiently 
endure it. God himself is angry with the wicked every day, and it 
is written in His Word, “Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.” Far more frequently it is to be feared that our anger is not commendable 
or even justifiable, and then we must answer, “NO.” Why should we be fretful with children, passionate with servants, 
and wrathful with companions? Is such anger honourable to our Christian 
profession, or glorifying to God? Is it not the old evil heart seeking 
to gain dominion, and should we not resist it with all the might of 
our newborn nature? Many professors give way to temper as though it 
were useless to attempt resistance; but let the believer remember 
that he must be a conqueror in every point, or else he cannot be crowned. 
If we cannot control our tempers, what has grace done for us? Some 
one told Mr. Jay that grace was often grafted on a crab-stump. “Yes,” said he, “but the fruit will not be crabs.” We must not make natural infirmity an excuse for sin, but we must 
fly to the cross and pray the Lord to crucify our tempers, and renew 
us in gentleness and meekness after His own image.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0713pm-p3">It is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning 
of this delightful phrase, “<i>God is for me</i>.” He was “for us” before the worlds were made; he was “for us,” or he would not have given his well-beloved son; he was “for us” when he smote the Only-begotten, and laid the full weight of his 
wrath upon him—he was “for <i>us</i>,” though he was against <i>him</i>; he was “for us,” when we were ruined in the fall—he loved us notwithstanding all; he was “for us,” when we were rebels against him, and with a high hand were bidding 
him defiance; he was “for us,” or he would not have brought us humbly to seek his face. He has been 
“for us” in many struggles; we have been summoned to encounter hosts of dangers; 
we have been assailed by temptations from without and within—how could we have remained unharmed to this hour if he had not been 
“for us”? He is “for us,” with all the infinity of his being; with all the omnipotence of his 
love; with all the infallibility of his wisdom; arrayed in all his 
divine attributes, he is “for us,”—eternally and immutably “for us”; “for us” when yon blue skies shall be rolled up like a worn out vesture; “for us” throughout eternity. And because he is “for us,” the voice of prayer will always ensure his help. “<i>When I cry unto thee,</i> <i>then shall mine enemies be turned back</i>.” This is no uncertain hope, but a well grounded assurance—“<i>this I</i> <i>know</i>.” I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up for the answer, 
assured that it will come, and that mine enemies shall be defeated, 
“for God is for me.” O believer, how happy art thou with the King of kings on thy side! 
How safe with such a Protector! How sure thy cause pleaded by such 
an Advocate! If God be for thee, who can be against thee?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0714am-p3">God’s altar was to be built of unhewn stones, that no trace of human skill 
or labour might be seen upon it. Human wisdom delights to trim and 
arrange the doctrines of the cross into a system more artificial and 
more congenial with the depraved tastes of fallen nature; instead, 
however, of improving the gospel carnal wisdom pollutes it, until 
it becomes another gospel, and not the truth of God at all. All alterations 
and amendments of the Lord’s own Word are defilements and pollutions. The proud heart of man 
is very anxious to have a hand in the justification of the soul before 
God; preparations for Christ are dreamed of, humblings and repentings 
are trusted in, good works are cried up, natural ability is much vaunted, 
and by all means the attempt is made to lift up human tools upon the 
divine altar. It were well if sinners would remember that so far from 
perfecting the Saviour’s work, their carnal confidences only pollute and dishonour it. The 
Lord alone must be exalted in the work of atonement, and not a single 
mark of man’s chisel or hammer will be endured. There is an inherent blasphemy 
in seeking to add to what Christ Jesus in His dying moments declared 
to be finished, or to improve that in which the Lord Jehovah finds 
perfect satisfaction. Trembling sinner, away with thy tools, and fall 
upon thy knees in humble supplication; and accept the Lord Jesus to 
be the altar of thine atonement, and rest in him alone.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0714am-p4">Many professors may take warning from this morning’s text as to the doctrines which they believe. There is among Christians 
far too much inclination to square and reconcile the truths of revelation; 
this is a form of irreverence and unbelief, let us strive against 
it, and receive truth as we find it; rejoicing that the doctrines 
of the Word are unhewn stones, and so are all the more fit to build 
an altar for the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0714pm-p3">Let us learn from Mary Magdalene how to obtain fellowship with the 
Lord Jesus. Notice how she sought. She sought the Saviour <i>very early</i> in the morning. If thou canst wait for Christ, and be patient in 
the hope of having fellowship with him at some distant season, thou 
wilt never have fellowship at all; for the heart that is fitted for 
communion is a hungering and a thirsting heart. She sought him also 
with <i>very great</i> <i>boldness</i>. Other disciples fled from the sepulchre, for they trembled and were 
amazed; but Mary, it is said, “stood” at the sepulchre. If you would have Christ with you, seek him boldly. 
Let nothing hold you back. Defy the world. Press on where others flee. 
She sought Christ <i>faithfully</i>—she stood <i>at the</i> <i>sepulchre</i>. Some find it hard to stand by a living Saviour, but she stood by 
a dead one. Let us seek Christ after this mode, cleaving to the very 
least thing that has to do with him, remaining faithful though all 
others should forsake him. Note further, she sought Jesus <i>earnestly</i>—she stood “<i>weeping</i>”. Those tear-droppings were as spells that led the Saviour captive, 
and made him come forth and show himself to her. If you desire Jesus’ presence, weep after it! If you cannot be happy unless he come and 
say to you, “Thou art my beloved,” you will soon hear his voice. Lastly, she sought the Saviour <i>only</i>. What cared she for angels, she turned herself back from them; her 
search was only for her Lord. If Christ be your one and only love, 
if your heart has cast out all rivals, you will not long lack the 
comfort of his presence. Mary Magdalene sought thus <i>because she loved much</i>. Let us arouse ourselves to the same intensity of affection; let 
our heart, like Mary's, be full of Christ, and our love, like hers, 
will be satisfied with nothing short of himself. O Lord, reveal thyself 
to us this evening!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0715am-p3">Keep the altar of <i>private prayer</i> burning. This is the very life of all piety. The sanctuary and family 
altars borrow their fires here, therefore let this burn well. Secret 
devotion is the very essence, evidence, and barometer, of vital and 
experimental religion.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0715am-p4">Burn here the fat of your sacrifices. Let your closet seasons be, 
if possible, regular, frequent, and undisturbed. Effectual prayer 
availeth much. Have you nothing to pray for? Let us suggest the Church, 
the ministry, your own soul, your children, your relations, your neighbours, 
your country, and the cause of God and truth throughout the world. 
Let us examine ourselves on this important matter. Do we engage with 
lukewarmness in private devotion? Is the fire of devotion burning 
dimly in our hearts? Do the chariot wheels drag heavily? If so, let 
us be alarmed at this sign of decay. Let us go with weeping, and ask 
for the Spirit of grace and of supplications. Let us set apart special 
seasons for extraordinary prayer. For if this fire should be smothered 
beneath the ashes of a worldly conformity, it will dim the fire on 
the family altar, and lessen our influence both in the Church and 
in the world.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0715am-p5">The text will also apply to <i>the altar of the heart</i>. This is a golden altar indeed. God loves to see the hearts of his 
people glowing towards himself. Let us give to God our hearts, all 
blazing with love, and seek his grace, that the fire may never be 
quenched; for it will not burn if the Lord does not keep it burning. 
Many foes will attempt to extinguish it; but if the unseen hand behind 
the wall pour thereon the sacred oil, it will blaze higher and higher. 
Let us use texts of Scripture as fuel for our heart’s fire, they are live coals; let us attend sermons, but above all, 
let us be much alone with Jesus.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0715pm-p3">Jesus “appeared first to Mary Magdalene,” probably not only on account of her great love and persevering seeking, 
but because, as the context intimates,<i>she had been a special</i> <i>trophy of Christ’s delivering power</i>. Learn from this, that the greatness of our sin before conversion 
should not make us imagine that we may not be specially favoured with 
the very highest grade of fellowship. She was one who had left all 
to become <i>a constant attendant on the Saviour</i>. He was her first, her chief object. Many who were on Christ’s side did not take up Christ’s cross; <i>she</i> did. <i>She spent her substance</i> <i>in relieving his wants</i>. If we would see much of Christ, let us <i>serve</i> him. Tell me who they are that sit oftenest under the banner of his 
love, and drink deepest draughts from the cup of communion, and I 
am sure they will be those who give most, who serve best, and who 
abide closest to the bleeding heart of their dear Lord. But notice 
<i>how</i> Christ revealed himself to this sorrowing one—by a <i>word</i>, “Mary.” It needed but one word <i>in his voice</i>, and at once she knew him, and <i>her heart</i> <i>owned allegiance by another word</i>, her heart was too full to say more. That one word would naturally 
be the most fitting for the occasion. It implies obedience. She said, 
“<i>Master</i>.” There is no state of mind in which this confession of allegiance 
will be too cold. No, when your spirit glows most with the heavenly 
fire, then you will say, “I am thy servant, thou hast loosed my bonds.” If you can say, “Master,” if you feel that his will is your will, then you stand in a happy, 
holy place. He must have said, “Mary,” or else you could not have said, “Rabboni.” See, then, from all this, how Christ honours those who honour him, 
how love draws our Beloved, how it needs but one word of his to turn 
our weeping to rejoicing, how his presence makes the heart’s sunshine.</p>

All must come from Jesus, or thou art undone forever. Old anointings 
will not suffice to impart unction to thy spirit; thine head must 
have fresh oil poured upon it from the golden horn of the sanctuary, 
or it will cease from its glory. To-day thou mayest be upon the summit 
of the mount of God, but he who has put thee there must keep thee 
there, or thou wilt sink far more speedily than thou dreamest. Thy 
mountain only stands firm when he settles it in its place; if he hide 
his face, thou wilt soon be troubled. If the Saviour should see fit, 
there is not a window through which thou seest the light of heaven 
which he could not darken in an instant. Joshua bade the sun stand 
still, but Jesus can shroud it in total darkness. He can withdraw 
the joy of thine heart, the light of thine eyes, and the strength 
of thy life; in his hand thy comforts lie, and at his will they can 
depart from thee. This hourly dependence our Lord is determined that 
we shall feel and recognize, for he only permits us to pray for “daily bread,” and only promises that “as our days our strength shall be.” Is it not best for us that it should be so, that we may often repair 
to his throne, and constantly be reminded of his love? Oh! how rich 
the grace which supplies us so continually, and doth not refrain itself 
because of our ingratitude! The golden shower never ceases, the cloud 
of blessing tarries evermore above our habitation. O Lord Jesus, we 
would bow at thy feet, conscious of our utter inability to do anything 
without thee, and in every favour which we are privileged to receive, 
we would adore thy blessed name and acknowledge thine unexhausted 
love.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0716pm-p3">A selfish man in trouble is exceedingly hard to comfort, because the 
springs of his comfort lie entirely within himself, and when he is 
sad all his springs are dry. But a large-hearted man full of Christian 
philanthropy, has other springs from which to supply himself with 
comfort beside those which lie within. He can go to his God first 
of all, and there find abundant help; and he can discover arguments 
for consolation in things relating to the world at large, to his country, 
and, above all, to the church. David in this Psalm was exceedingly 
sorrowful; he wrote, “I am like an owl of the desert. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone 
upon the house top.” The only way in which he could comfort himself, was in the reflection 
that God would arise, and have mercy upon Zion: though <i>he</i> was sad, yet Zion should prosper; however low his own estate, yet 
Zion should arise. Christian man! learn to comfort thyself in God’s gracious dealing towards the church. That which is so dear to thy 
Master, should it not be dear above all else to thee? What though 
thy way be dark, canst thou not gladden thine heart with the triumphs 
of his cross and the spread of his truth? Our own personal troubles 
are forgotten while we look, not only upon what God <i>has</i> done, and is doing for Zion, but on the glorious things he <i>will yet do</i> for his church. Try this receipt, O believer, whenever thou art sad 
of heart and in heaviness of spirit: forget thyself and thy little 
concerns, and seek the welfare and prosperity of Zion. When thou bendest 
thy knee in prayer to God, limit not thy petition to the narrow circle 
of thine own life, tried though it be, but send out thy longing prayers 
for the church’s prosperity, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem,” and thine own soul shall be refreshed.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0717am-p3">Many persons want to know their election before they look to Christ, 
but they cannot learn it thus, it is only to be discovered by “looking unto Jesus.” If you desire to ascertain your own election;—after the following manner, shall you assure your heart before God. 
Do you feel yourself to be a lost, guilty sinner? go straightway to 
the cross of Christ, and tell Jesus so, and tell him that you have 
read in the Bible, “Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.” Tell him that he has said, “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ 
Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” Look to Jesus and believe on him, and you shall make proof of your 
election directly, for so surely as thou believest, thou art elect. 
If you will give yourself wholly up to Christ and trust him, then 
you are one of God’s chosen ones; but if you stop and say, “I want to know first whether I am elect,” you ask you know not what. Go to Jesus, be you never so guilty, just 
as you are. Leave all curious inquiry about election alone. Go straight 
to Christ and hide in his wounds, and you shall know your election. 
The assurance of the Holy Spirit shall be given to you, so that you 
shall be able to say, “I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to 
keep that which I have committed to him.” Christ was at the everlasting council: he can tell you whether you 
were chosen or not; but you cannot find it out in any other way. Go 
and put your trust in him, and his answer will be—“I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with lovingkindness 
have I drawn thee.” There will be no doubt about his having chosen <i>you</i>, when you have chosen <i>him</i>.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0717pm-p3">When the prophet Elijah had received the answer to his prayer, and 
the fire from heaven had consumed the sacrifice in the presence of 
all the people, he called upon the assembled Israelites to take the 
priests of Baal, and sternly cried, “Let not one of them escape.” He took them all down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. So 
must it be with our sins—they are all doomed, not one must be preserved. Our darling sin must 
die. Spare it not for its much crying. Strike, though it be as dear 
as an Isaac. Strike, for God struck at sin when it was laid upon his 
own Son. With stern unflinching purpose must you condemn to death 
that sin which was once the idol of your heart. Do you ask how you 
are to accomplish this? Jesus will be your power. You have grace to 
overcome sin given you in the covenant of grace; you have strength 
to win the victory in the crusade against inward lusts, because Christ 
Jesus has promised to be with you even unto the end. If you would 
triumph over darkness, set yourself in the presence of the Sun of 
Righteousness. There is no place so well adapted for the discovery 
of sin, and recovery from its power and guilt, as the immediate presence 
of God. Job never knew how to get rid of sin half so well as he did 
when his eye of faith rested upon God, and then he abhorred himself, 
and repented in dust and ashes. The fine gold of the Christian is 
oft becoming dim. We need the sacred fire to consume the dross. Let 
us fly to our God, he is a consuming fire; he will not consume our 
spirit, but our sins. Let the goodness of God excite us to a sacred 
jealousy, and to a holy revenge against those iniquities which are 
hateful in his sight. Go forth to battle with Amalek, in his strength, 
and utterly destroy the accursed crew: let not one of them escape.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0718am-p3">The camp of Dan brought up the rear when the armies of Israel were 
on the march. The Danites occupied <i>the hindmost place</i>, but what mattered the position, since they were as truly part of 
the host as were the foremost tribes; they followed the same fiery 
cloudy pillar, they ate of the same manna, drank of the same spiritual 
rock, and journeyed to the same inheritance. Come, my heart, cheer 
up, though last and least; it is thy privilege to be in the army, 
and to fare as they fare who lead the van. Some one must be hindmost 
in honour and esteem, some one must do menial work for Jesus, and 
why should not I? In a poor village, among an ignorant peasantry; 
or in a back street, among degraded sinners, I will work on, and “go hindmost with my standard.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0718am-p4">The Danites occupied <i>a very useful place</i>. Stragglers have to be picked up upon the march, and lost property 
has to be gathered from the field. Fiery spirits may dash forward 
over untrodden paths to learn fresh truth, and win more souls to Jesus; 
but some of a more conservative spirit may be well engaged in reminding 
the church of her ancient faith, and restoring her fainting sons. 
Every position has its duties, and the slowly moving children of God 
will find their peculiar state one in which they may be eminently 
a blessing to the whole host.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0718am-p5">The rear guard is <i>a place of danger</i>. There are foes behind us as well as before us. Attacks may come 
from any quarter. We read that Amalek fell upon Israel, and slew some 
of the hindmost of them. The experienced Christian will find much 
work for his weapons in aiding those poor doubting, desponding, wavering, 
souls, who are hindmost in faith, knowledge, and joy. These must not 
be left unaided, and therefore be it the business of well-taught saints 
to bear their standards among the hindmost. My soul, do thou tenderly 
watch to help the hindmost this day.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0718pm-p3">Locusts always keep their rank, and although their number is legion, 
they do not crowd upon each other, so as to throw their columns into 
confusion. This remarkable fact in natural history shows how thoroughly 
the Lord has infused the spirit of order into his universe, since 
the smallest animate creatures are as much controlled by it as are 
the rolling spheres or the seraphic messengers. It would be wise for 
believers to be ruled by the same influence in all their spiritual 
life. <i>In their Christian</i> <i>graces</i> no one virtue should usurp the sphere of another, or eat out the 
vitals of the rest for its own support. Affection must not smother 
honesty, courage must not elbow weakness out of the field, modesty 
must not jostle energy, and patience must not slaughter resolution. 
So also with <i>our duties</i>, one must not interfere with another; public usefulness must not 
injure private piety; church work must not push family worship into 
a corner. It is ill to offer God one duty stained with the blood of 
another. Each thing is beautiful in its season, but not otherwise. 
It was to the Pharisee that Jesus said, “This ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.” The same rule applies to <i>our personal position</i>, we must take care to know our place, take it, and keep to it. We 
must minister as the Spirit has given us ability, and not intrude 
upon our fellow servant’s domain. Our Lord Jesus taught us not to covet the high places, but 
to be willing to be the least among the brethren. Far from us be an 
envious, ambitious spirit, let us feel the force of the Master’s command, and do as he bids us, keeping rank with the rest of the 
host. To-night let us see whether we are keeping the unity of the 
Spirit in the bonds of peace, and let our prayer be that, in all the 
churches of the Lord Jesus, peace and order may prevail.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0719am-p3">God’s great design in all his works is the manifestation of his own glory. 
Any aim less than this were unworthy of himself. But how shall the 
glory of God be manifested to such fallen creatures as we are? Man’s eye is not single, he has ever a side glance towards his own honour, 
has too high an estimate of his own powers, and so is not qualified 
to behold the glory of the Lord. It is clear, then, that self must 
stand out of the way, that there may be room for God to be exalted; 
and this is the reason why he bringeth his people ofttimes into straits 
and difficulties, that, being made conscious of their own folly and 
weakness, they may be fitted to behold the majesty of God when he 
comes forth to work their deliverance. He whose life is one even and 
smooth path, will see but little of the glory of the Lord, for he 
has few occasions of self-emptying, and hence, but little fitness 
for being filled with the revelation of God. They who navigate little 
streams and shallow creeks, know but little of the God of tempests; 
but they who “do business in great waters,” these see his “wonders in the deep.” Among the huge Atlantic-waves of bereavement, poverty, temptation, 
and reproach, we learn the power of Jehovah, because we feel the littleness 
of man. Thank God, then, if you have been led by a rough road: it 
is this which has given you your experience of God’s greatness and lovingkindness. Your troubles have enriched you with 
a wealth of knowledge to be gained by no other means: your trials 
have been the cleft of the rock in which Jehovah has set you, as he 
did his servant Moses, that you might behold his glory as it passed 
by. Praise God that you have not been left to the darkness and ignorance 
which continued prosperity might have involved, but that in the great 
fight of affliction, you have been capacitated for the outshinings 
of his glory in his wonderful dealings with you.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0719pm-p3">What is weaker than the bruised reed or the smoking flax? <i>A</i> <i>reed</i> that groweth in the fen or marsh, let but the wild duck light upon 
it, and it snaps; let but the foot of man brush against it, and it 
is bruised and broken; every wind that flits across the river moves 
it to and fro. You can conceive of nothing more frail or brittle, 
or whose existence is more in jeopardy, than a bruised reed. Then 
look at the smoking flax—what is it? It has a spark within it, it is true, but it is almost 
smothered; an infant’s breath might blow it out; nothing has a more precarious existence 
than its flame. <i>Weak things</i> are here described, yet Jesus says of them, “The smoking flax I will not quench; the bruised reed I will not break.” Some of God’s children are made strong to do mighty works for him; God has his 
Samsons here and there who can pull up Gaza’s gates, and carry them to the top of the hill; he has a few mighties 
who are lion-like men, but the majority of his people are a timid, 
trembling race. They are like starlings, frightened at every passer 
by; a little fearful flock. If temptation comes, they are taken like 
birds in a snare; if trial threatens, they are ready to faint; their 
frail skiff is tossed up and down by every wave, they are drifted 
along like a sea bird on the crest of the billows—weak things, without strength, without wisdom, without foresight. 
Yet, weak as they are, and <i>because</i> they are so weak, they have this promise made specially to them. 
Herein is grace and graciousness! Herein is love and lovingkindness! 
How it opens to us the compassion of Jesus—so gentle, tender, considerate! We need never shrink back from <i>his</i> touch. We need never fear a harsh word from <i>him</i>; though he might well chide us for our weakness, he rebuketh not. 
Bruised reeds shall have no blows from him, and the smoking flax no 
damping frowns.</p>

of heart is experienced by that man who has learned to feed on Jesus, 
and on Jesus alone. Yet the realization which we have of Christ’s preciousness is, in this life, imperfect at the best. As an old 
writer says, “'Tis but a taste!” We have tasted “that the Lord is gracious,” but we do not yet know <i>how</i> good and gracious he is, although what we know of his sweetness makes 
us long for more. We have enjoyed the firstfruits of the Spirit, and 
they have set us hungering and thirsting for the fulness of the heavenly 
vintage. We groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption. <i>Here</i> we are like Israel in the wilderness, who had but one cluster from 
Eshcol, <i>there</i> we shall be in the vineyard. Here we see the manna falling small, 
like coriander seed, but there shall we eat the bread of heaven and 
the old corn of the kingdom. We are but beginners now in spiritual 
education; for although we have learned the first letters of the alphabet, 
we cannot read words yet, much less can we put sentences together; 
but as one says, “He that has been in heaven but five minutes, knows more than the general 
assembly of divines on earth.” We have many ungratified desires at present, but soon every wish 
shall be satisfied; and all our powers shall find the sweetest employment 
in that eternal world of joy. O Christian, antedate heaven for a few

had proved himself to be worthy of Israel’s trust. Yet they broke down the hedges with which God had enclosed 
them as a sacred garden; they forsook their own true and living God, 
and followed after false gods. Constantly did the Lord reprove them 
for this infatuation, and our text contains one instance of God’s expostulating with them, “What hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of the 
muddy river?”—for so it may be translated. “Why dost thou wander afar and leave thine own cool stream from Lebanon? 
Why dost thou forsake Jerusalem to turn aside to Noph and to Tahapanes? 
Why art thou so strangely set on mischief, that thou canst not be 
content with the good and healthful, but wouldst follow after that 
which is evil and deceitful?” Is there not here a word of expostulation and warning to the Christian? 
O true believer, called by grace and washed in the precious blood 
of Jesus, thou hast tasted of better drink than the muddy river of 
this world’s pleasure can give thee; thou hast had fellowship with Christ; thou 
hast obtained the joy of seeing Jesus, and leaning thine head upon 
his bosom. Do the trifles, the songs, the honours, the merriment of 
this earth content thee after that? Hast thou eaten the bread of angels, 
and canst thou live on husks? Good Rutherford once said, “I have tasted of Christ’s own manna, and it hath put my mouth out of taste for the brown bread 
of this world’s joys.” Methinks it should be so with thee. If thou art wandering after the 
waters of Egypt, O return quickly to the one living fountain: the 
waters of Sihor may be sweet to the Egyptians, but they will prove 
only bitterness to thee. What hast thou to do with them? <i>Jesus asks thee this</i> <i>question this evening</i>—what wilt thou answer him?</p>

he espoused his Church as a chaste virgin, long before she fell under 
the yoke of bondage. Full of burning affection he toiled, like Jacob 
for Rachel, until the whole of her purchase-money had been paid, and 
now, having sought her by his Spirit, and brought her to know and 
love him, he awaits the glorious hour when their mutual bliss shall 
be consummated at the marriage-supper of the Lamb. Not yet hath the 
glorious Bridegroom presented his betrothed, perfected and complete, 
before the Majesty of heaven; not yet hath she actually entered upon 
the enjoyment of her dignities as his wife and queen: she is as yet 
a wanderer in a world of woe, a dweller in the tents of Kedar; but 
she is even now the bride, the spouse of Jesus, dear to his heart, 
precious in his sight, written on his hands, and united with his person. 
On earth he exercises towards her all the affectionate offices of 
Husband. He makes rich provision for her wants, pays all her debts, 
allows her to assume his name, and to share in all his wealth. Nor 
will he ever act otherwise to her. The word divorce he will never 
mention, for “He hateth putting away.” Death must sever the conjugal tie between the most loving mortals, 
but it cannot divide the links of this immortal marriage. In heaven 
they marry not, but are as the angels of God; yet there is this one 
marvellous exception to the rule, for in Heaven Christ and his Church 
shall celebrate their joyous nuptials. This affinity as it is more 
lasting, so is it more near than earthly wedlock. Let the love of 
husband be never so pure and fervent, it is but a faint picture of 
the flame which burns in the heart of Jesus. Passing all human union 
is that mystical cleaving unto the Church, for which Christ left his 
Father, and became one flesh with her.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0722pm-p3">If there be one place where our Lord Jesus most fully becomes the 
joy and comfort of his people, it is where he plunged deepest into 
the depths of woe. Come hither, gracious souls, and behold the man 
in the garden of Gethsemane; behold his heart so brimming with love 
that he cannot hold it in—so full of sorrow that it must find a vent. Behold the bloody sweat 
as it distils from every pore of his body, and falls upon the ground. 
Behold the man as they drive the nails into his hands and feet. Look 
up, repenting sinners, and see the sorrowful image of your suffering 
Lord. Mark him, as the ruby drops stand on the thorn-crown, and adorn 
with priceless gems the diadem of the King of Misery. Behold the man 
when all his bones are out of joint, and he is poured out like water 
and brought into the dust of death; God hath forsaken him, and hell 
compasseth him about. Behold and see, was there ever sorrow like unto 
his sorrow that is done unto him? All ye that pass by draw near and 
look upon this spectacle of grief, unique, unparalleled, a wonder 
to men and angels, a prodigy unmatched. Behold the Emperor of Woe 
who had no equal or rival in his agonies! Gaze upon him, ye mourners, 
for if there be not consolation in a crucified Christ there is no 
joy in earth or heaven. If in the ransom price of his blood there 
be not hope, ye harps of heaven, there is no joy in you, and the right 
hand of God shall know no pleasures for evermore. We have only to 
sit more continually at the cross foot to be less troubled with our 
doubts and woes. We have but to see <i>his</i> sorrows, and <i>our</i> sorrows we shall be ashamed to mention. We have but to gaze into 
his wounds and heal our own. If we would live aright it must be by 
the contemplation of his death; if we would rise to dignity, it must 
be by considering his humiliation and his sorrow.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0723am-p3">Brotherly kindness was due from Edom to Israel in the time of need, 
but instead thereof, the men of Esau made common cause with Israel’s foes. Special stress in the sentence before us is laid upon the 
word <i>thou</i>; as when Caesar cried to Brutus, “and <i>thou</i> Brutus”; a bad action may be all the worse, because of the person who has 
committed it. When <i>we</i> sin, who are the chosen favourites of heaven, we sin with an emphasis; 
ours is a crying offence, because we are so peculiarly indulged. If 
an angel should lay his hand upon us when we are doing evil, he need 
not use any other rebuke than the question, “What <i>thou</i>? What dost <i>thou</i> here?” Much forgiven, much delivered, much instructed, much enriched, much

certain men laughed at uncleanness, and the joke was not altogether 
offensive to thine ear, <i>even thou wast as</i> <i>one of them</i>. When hard things were spoken concerning the ways of God, thou wast 
bashfully silent; and so, to on-lookers, <i>thou wast as one of them</i>. When worldlings were bartering in the market, and driving hard bargains, 
wast thou not as one of them? When they were pursuing vanity with 
a hunter’s foot, wert thou not as greedy for gain as they were? Could any difference 
be discerned between thee and them? <i>Is there any difference</i>? Here we come to close quarters. Be honest with thine own soul, and 
make sure that thou art a new creature in Christ Jesus; but when this 
is sure, walk jealously, lest any should again be able to say, “Even thou wast as one of them.” Thou wouldst not desire to share their eternal doom, why then be 
like them here? Come not thou into their secret, lest thou come into 
their ruin. Side with the afflicted people of God, and not with the

<p class="normal" id="d0723pm-p3">“Cleanseth,” says the text—not “<i>shall</i> cleanse.” There are multitudes who think that as a dying hope they may look 
forward to pardon. Oh! how infinitely better to have cleansing now 
than to depend on the bare possibility of forgiveness when I come 
to die. Some imagine that a sense of pardon is an attainment only 
obtainable after many years of Christian experience. But forgiveness 
of sin is a <i>present</i> thing—a privilege for this day, a joy for this very hour. The moment a sinner 
trusts Jesus he is fully forgiven. The text, being written in the 
present tense, also indicates <i>continuance</i>; it was “cleanseth” yesterday, it is “cleanseth” today, it will be “cleanseth” tomorrow: it will be always so with you, Christian, until you cross 
the river; every hour you may come to this fountain, for it cleanseth 
still. Notice, likewise, the <i>completeness</i> of the cleansing, “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from <i>all</i> sin”—not only from sin, but “from all sin.” Reader, I cannot tell you the exceeding sweetness of this word, but 
I pray God the Holy Ghost to give you a taste of it. Manifold are 
our sins against God. Whether the bill be little or great, the same 
receipt can discharge one as the other. The blood of Jesus Christ 
is as blessed and divine a payment for the transgressions of blaspheming 
Peter as for the shortcomings of loving John; our iniquity is gone, 
all gone at once, and all gone forever. Blessed completeness! What 
a sweet theme to dwell upon as one gives himself to sleep.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0724am-p3">These words contain God’s command to the believer when he is reduced to great straits and 
brought into extraordinary difficulties. He cannot retreat; he cannot 
go forward; he is shut up on the right hand and on the left; what 
is he now to do? The Master’s word to him is, “Stand still.” It will be well for him if at such times he listens only to his Master’s word, for other and evil advisers come with their suggestions. <i>Despair</i> whispers, “Lie down and die; give it all up.” But God would have us put on a cheerful courage, and even in our 
worst times, rejoice in his love and faithfulness. <i>Cowardice</i> says, “Retreat; go back to the worldling’s way of action; you cannot play the Christian’s part, it is too difficult. Relinquish your principles.” But, however much Satan may urge this course upon you, you cannot 
follow it if you are a child of God. His divine fiat has bid thee 
go from strength to strength, and so thou shalt, and neither death 
nor hell shall turn thee from thy course. What, if for a while thou 
art called to stand still, yet this is but to renew thy strength for 
some greater advance in due time. <i>Precipitancy</i> cries, “do something. Stir yourself; to stand still and wait, is sheer idleness.” We <i>must</i> be doing something at once—<i>we</i> must do it so we think—instead of looking to the Lord, who will not only do something but 
will do everything. <i>Presumption</i> boasts, “If the sea be before you, march into it and expect a miracle.” But Faith listens neither to Presumption, nor to Despair, nor to 
Cowardice, nor to Precipitancy, but it hears God say, “Stand still,” and immovable as a rock it stands. “<i>Stand</i> still;”—keep the posture of an upright man, ready for action, expecting further 
orders, cheerfully and patiently awaiting the directing voice; and 
it will not be long ere God shall say to you, as distinctly as Moses 
said it to the people of Israel, “Go forward.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0724pm-p3">Consider, my soul, the mightiness of the Lord who is thy glory and 
defence. He is a man of war, Jehovah is his name. All <i>the forces of heaven</i> are at his beck, legions wait at his door, cherubim and seraphim;, 
watchers and holy ones, principalities and powers, are all attentive 
to his will. If our eyes were not blinded by the ophthalmia of the 
flesh, we should see horses of fire and chariots of fire round about 
the Lord’s beloved. <i>The powers of nature</i> are all subject to the absolute control of the Creator: stormy wind 
and tempest, lightning and rain, and snow, and hail, and the soft 
dews and cheering sunshine, come and go at his decree. The bands of 
Orion he looseth, and bindeth the sweet influences of the Pleiades. 
Earth, sea, and air, and the places under the earth, are the barracks 
for Jehovah’s great armies; space is his camping ground, light is his banner, 
and flame is his sword. When he goeth forth to war, famine ravages 
the land, pestilence smites the nations, hurricane sweeps the sea, 
tornado shakes the mountains, and earthquake makes the solid world 
to tremble. As for <i>animate creatures</i>, they all own his dominion, and from the great fish which swallowed 
the prophet, down to “all manner of flies,” which plagued the field of Zoan, all are his servants, and like the 
palmer-worm, the caterpillar, and the cankerworm, are squadrons of 
his great army, for his camp is very great. My soul, see to it that 
thou be at peace with this mighty King, yea, more, be sure to enlist 
under his banner, for to war against him is madness, and to serve 
him is glory. Jesus, Immanuel, God with us, is ready to receive recruits 
for the army of the Lord: if I am not already enlisted let me go to 
him ere I sleep, and beg to be accepted through his merits; and if 
I be already, as I hope I am, a soldier of the cross, let me be of 
good courage; for the enemy is powerless compared with my Lord, whose 
camp is very great.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0725am-p3">In contending with certain sins there remains no mode of victory but 
by flight. The ancient naturalists wrote much of basilisks, whose 
eyes fascinated their victims and rendered them easy victims; so the 
mere gaze of wickedness puts us in solemn danger. He who would be 
safe from acts of evil must haste away from occasions of it. A covenant 
must be made with our eyes not even to look upon the cause of temptation, 
for such sins only need a spark to begin with and a blaze follows 
in an instant. Who would wantonly enter the leper’s prison and sleep amid its horrible corruption? He only who desires 
to be leprous himself would thus court contagion. If the mariner knew 
how to avoid a storm, he would do anything rather than run the risk 
of weathering it. Cautious pilots have no desire to try how near the 
quicksand they can sail, or how often they may touch a rock without 
springing a leak; their aim is to keep as nearly as possible in the 
midst of a safe channel.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0725am-p4">This day I may be exposed to great peril, let me have the serpent’s wisdom to keep out of it and avoid it. The wings of a dove may be 
of more use to me today than the jaws of a lion. It is true I may 
be an apparent loser by declining evil company, but I had better leave 
my cloak than lose my character; it is not needful that I should be 
rich, but it is imperative upon me to be pure. No ties of friendship, 
no chains of beauty, no flashings of talent, no shafts of ridicule 
must turn me from the wise resolve to flee from sin. The devil I am 
to resist and he will flee from me, but the lusts of the flesh, <i>I</i> must flee, or they will surely overcome me. O God of holiness preserve 
thy Josephs, that Madam Bubble bewitch them not with her vile suggestions. 
May the horrible trinity of the world, the flesh, and the devil, never 
overcome us!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0725pm-p3">Losses and adversities are frequently the means which the great Shepherd 
uses to fetch home his wandering sheep; like fierce dogs they worry 
the wanderers back to the fold. There is no making lions tame if they 
are too well fed; they must be brought down from their great strength, 
and their stomachs must be lowered, and then they will submit to the 
tamer’s hand; and often have we seen the Christian rendered obedient to 
the Lord’s will by straitness of bread and hard labour. When rich and increased 
in goods many professors carry their heads much too loftily, and speak 
exceeding boastfully. Like David, they flatter themselves, “My mountain standeth fast; I shall never be moved.” When the Christian groweth wealthy, is in good repute, hath good 
health, and a happy family, he too often admits Mr. Carnal Security 
to feast at his table, and then if he be a true child of God there 
is a rod preparing for him. Wait awhile, and it may be you will see 
his substance melt away as a dream. There goes a portion of his estate—how soon the acres change hands. That debt, that dishonoured bill—how fast his losses roll in, where will they end? It is a blessed 
sign of divine life if when these embarrassments occur one after another 
he begins to be distressed about his backslidings, and betakes himself 
to his God. Blessed are the waves that wash the mariner upon the rock 
of salvation! Losses in business are often sanctified to our soul’s enriching. If the chosen soul will not come to the Lord full-handed, 
it shall come empty. If God, in his grace, findeth no other means 
of making us honour him among men, he will cast us into the deep; 
if we fail to honour him on the pinnacle of riches, he will bring 
us into the valley of poverty. Yet faint not, heir of sorrow, when 
thou art thus rebuked, rather recognize the loving hand which chastens, 
and say, “I will arise, and go unto my Father.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0726am-p3">If thou wouldest enjoy the eminent grace of the full assurance of 
faith, under the blessed Spirit’s influence, and assistance, do what the Scripture tells thee, “<i>Give</i> <i>diligence</i>.” Take care that thy <i>faith</i> is of the right kind—that it is not a mere belief of doctrine, but a simple faith, depending 
on Christ, and on Christ alone. Give diligent heed to thy <i>courage</i>. Plead with God that he would give thee the face of a lion, that 
thou mayest, with a consciousness of right, go on boldly. Study well 
the Scriptures, and get <i>knowledge</i>; for a knowledge of doctrine will tend very much to confirm faith. 
Try to understand God’s Word; let it dwell in thy heart richly.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0726am-p4">When thou hast done this, “Add to thy knowledge <i>temperance</i>.” Take heed to thy body: be temperate without. Take heed to thy soul: 
be temperate within. Get temperance of lip, life, heart, and thought. 
Add to this, by God’s Holy Spirit, <i>patience</i>; ask him to give thee that patience which endureth affliction, which, 
when it is tried, shall come forth as gold. Array yourself with patience, 
that you may not murmur nor be depressed in your afflictions. When 
that grace is won look to <i>godliness</i>. Godliness is something more than religion. Make God’s glory your object in life; live in his sight; dwell close to him; 
seek for fellowship with him; and thou hast “godliness”; and to that add <i>brotherly love</i>. Have a love to all the saints: and add to that a <i>charity</i>, which openeth its arms to all men, and loves their souls. When you 
are adorned with these jewels, and just in proportion as you practise 
these heavenly virtues, will you come to know by clearest evidence 
“your calling and election.” “Give diligence,” if you would get assurance, for lukewarmness and doubting very naturally 
go hand in hand.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0726pm-p3">Our spiritual privileges are of the highest order. “Among princes” <i>is the place of select society</i>. “Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.” Speak of select society, there is none like this! “We are a chosen generation, a peculiar people, a royal priesthood.” “We are come unto the general assembly and church of the first-born, 
whose names are written in heaven.” The saints <i>have courtly</i> <i>audience</i>: princes have admittance to royalty when common people must stand 
afar off. The child of God has free access to the inner courts of 
heaven. “For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.” “Let us come boldly,” says the apostle, “<i>to the throne</i> of the heavenly grace.” Among princes there is <i>abundant wealth</i>, but what is the abundance of princes compared with the riches of 
believers? for “all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.” “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how 
shall he not with him also freely give us all things?” Princes have <i>peculiar power</i>. A prince of heaven’s empire has great influence: he wields a sceptre in his own domain; 
he sits upon Jesus’ throne, for “He hath made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever 
and ever.” We reign over the united kingdom of time and eternity. Princes, again, 
have <i>special</i> <i>honour</i>. We may look down upon all earth-born dignity from the eminence upon 
which grace has placed us. For what is human grandeur to this, “He hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly 
places in Christ Jesus”? We share the honour of Christ, and compared with this, earthly splendours 
are not worth a thought. Communion with Jesus is a richer gem than 
ever glittered in imperial diadem. Union with the Lord is a coronet 
of beauty outshining all the blaze of imperial pomp.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0727am-p3">If you would know experimentally the preciousness of the promises, 
and enjoy them in your own heart, <i>meditate much upon</i> <i>them</i>. There are promises which are like grapes in the wine-press; if you 
will tread them the juice will flow. Thinking over the hallowed words 
will often be the prelude to their fulfilment. While you are musing 
upon them, the boon which you are seeking will insensibly come to 
you. Many a Christian who has thirsted for the promise has found the 
favour which it ensured gently distilling into his soul even while 
he has been considering the divine record; and he has rejoiced that 
ever he was led to lay the promise near his heart.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0727am-p4">But besides <i>meditating</i> upon the promises, <i>seek in thy</i> <i>soul to receive them as being the very words of God</i>. Speak to thy soul thus, “If I were dealing with a man’s promise, I should carefully consider the ability and the character 
of the man who had covenanted with me. So with the promise of God; 
my eye must not be so much fixed upon the greatness of the mercy—that may stagger me; as upon the greatness of the promiser—that will cheer me. My soul, it is God, even thy God, God that cannot 
lie, who speaks to thee. This word of his which thou art now considering 
is as true as his own existence. He is a God unchangeable. He has 
not altered the thing which has gone out of his mouth, nor called 
back one single consolatory sentence. Nor doth he lack any power; 
it is the God that made the heavens and the earth who has spoken thus. 
Nor can he fail in wisdom as to the time when he will bestow the favours, 
for he knoweth when it is best to give and when better to withhold. 
Therefore, seeing that it is the word of a God so true, so immutable, 
so powerful, so wise, I will and must believe the promise.” If we thus meditate upon the promises, and consider the Promiser, 
we shall experience their sweetness, and obtain their fulfilment.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0727pm-p3">Most blessed challenge! How unanswerable it is! Every sin of the elect 
was laid upon the great Champion of our salvation, and by the atonement 
carried away. There is no sin in God’s book against his people: he seeth no sin in Jacob, neither iniquity 
in Israel; they are justified in Christ forever. When the guilt of 
sin was taken away, the punishment of sin was removed. For the Christian 
there is no stroke from God’s angry hand—nay, not so much as a single frown of punitive justice. The believer 
may be chastised by his Father, but God the Judge has nothing to say 
to the Christian, except “I have absolved thee: thou art acquitted.” For the Christian there is no penal death in this world, much less 
any second death. He is completely freed from all the punishment as 
well as the guilt of sin, and the power of sin is removed too. It 
may stand in our way, and agitate us with perpetual warfare; but sin 
is a conquered foe to every soul in union with Jesus. There is no 
sin which a Christian cannot overcome if he will only rely upon his 
God to do it. They who wear the white robe in heaven overcame through 
the blood of the Lamb, and we may do the same. No lust is too mighty, 
no besetting sin too strongly entrenched; we can overcome through 
the power of Christ. Do believe it, Christian, that thy sin is a condemned 
thing. It may kick and struggle, but it is doomed to die. God has 
written condemnation across its brow. Christ has crucified it, “nailing it to his cross.” Go now and mortify it, and the Lord help you to live to his praise, 
for sin with all its guilt, shame, and fear, is gone.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0728am-p3">Remember this is the confession of the man after God’s own heart; and in telling us his inner life, he writes, “So foolish was I, and ignorant.” The word “<i>foolish</i>,” here, means more than it signifies in ordinary language. David, in 
a former verse of the Psalm, writes, “I was envious at <i>the foolish</i> when I saw the prosperity of the wicked,” which shows that the folly he intended had sin in it. He puts himself 
down as being thus “foolish,” and adds a word which is to give intensity to it; “so foolish was I.” <i>How foolish</i> he could not tell. It was a sinful folly, a folly which was not to 
be excused by frailty, but to be condemned because of its perverseness 
and wilful ignorance, for he had been envious of the present prosperity 
of the ungodly, forgetful of the dreadful end awaiting all such. And 
are we better than David that we should call ourselves wise! Do we 
profess that we have attained perfection, or to have been so chastened 
that the rod has taken all our wilfulness out of us? Ah, this were 
pride indeed! If <i>David</i> was foolish, how foolish should <i>we</i> be in our own esteem if we could but see ourselves! Look back, believer: 
think of your doubting God when he has been so faithful to you—think of your foolish outcry of “Not so, my Father,” when he crossed his hands in affliction to give you the larger blessing; 
think of the many times when you have read his providences in the 
dark, misinterpreted his dispensations, and groaned out, “All these things are against me,” when they are all working together for your good! Think how often 
you have chosen sin because of its pleasure, when indeed, that pleasure 
was a root of bitterness to you! Surely if we know our own heart we 
must plead guilty to the indictment of a sinful folly; and conscious 
of this “foolishness,” we must make David’s consequent resolve our own—“<i>Thou shalt guide me with thy</i> <i>counsel</i>.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0728pm-p3">Few words, but yet an exquisite miniature of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
There are not many touches, but they are the strokes of a master’s pencil. Of the Saviour and only of the Saviour is it true in the 
fullest, broadest, and most unqualified sense. “He went about doing good.” From this description it is evident that he did good <i>personally</i>. The evangelists constantly tell us that he touched the leper with 
his own finger, that he anointed the eyes of the blind, and that in 
cases where he was asked to speak the word only at a distance, he 
did not usually comply, but went himself to the sick bed, and there 
personally wrought the cure. A lesson to us, if we would do good, 
to do it ourselves. Give alms with your own hand; a kind look, or 
word, will enhance the value of the gift. Speak to a friend about 
his soul; your loving appeal will have more influence than a whole 
library of tracts. Our Lord’s mode of doing good sets forth his <i>incessant activity</i>! He did not only the good which came close to hand, but he “went about” on his errands of mercy. Throughout the whole land of Judea there 
was scarcely a village or a hamlet which was not gladdened by the 
sight of him. How this reproves the creeping, loitering manner, in 
which many professors serve the Lord. Let us gird up the loins of 
our mind, and be not weary in well doing. Does not the text imply 
that Jesus Christ <i>went</i> <i>out of his way to do good</i>? “He went <i>about</i> doing good.” He was never deterred by danger or difficulty. He sought out the 
objects of his gracious intentions. So must we. If old plans will 
not answer, we must try new ones, for fresh experiments sometimes 
achieve more than regular methods. Christ’s <i>perseverance</i>, and the <i>unity</i> of his purpose, are also hinted at, and the practical application 
of the subject may be summed up in the words, “He hath left us an example that we should follow in his steps.”</p>

had just been confessing to God, not one atom the less was it true 
and certain that David was saved and accepted, and that the blessing 
of being constantly in God’s presence was undoubtedly his. Fully conscious of his own lost estate, 
and of the deceitfulness and vileness of his nature, yet, by a glorious 
outburst of faith, he sings “nevertheless I am continually with thee.” Believer, you are forced to enter into Asaph’s confession and acknowledgment, endeavour in like spirit to say “nevertheless, since I belong to Christ I am continually with God!” By this is meant continually upon his <i>mind</i>, he is always thinking of me for my good. Continually before his 
<i>eye</i>;—the eye of the Lord never sleepeth, but is perpetually watching over my welfare. Continually in his <i>hand</i>, so that none shall be able to pluck me thence. Continually on his 
<i>heart</i>, worn there as a memorial, even as the high priest bore the names 
of the twelve tribes upon his heart forever. Thou always thinkest 
of me, O God. The bowels of thy love continually yearn towards me. 
Thou art always making providence work for my good. Thou hast set 
me as a signet upon thine arm; thy love is strong as death, many waters 
cannot quench it; neither can the floods drown it. Surprising grace! 
Thou seest me in Christ, and though in myself abhorred, thou beholdest 
me as wearing Christ’s garments, and washed in his blood, and thus I stand accepted in 
thy presence. I am thus continually in thy favour—“continually with thee.” Here is comfort for the tried and afflicted soul; vexed with the 
tempest within—look at the calm without. “<i>Nevertheless</i>”—O say it in thy heart, and take the peace it gives. “Nevertheless I am continually with thee.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0729pm-p3">This declaration involves <i>the doctrine of election</i>: there are some whom the Father gave to Christ. It involves <i>the</i> <i>doctrine of effectual calling</i>: these who are given must and shall come; however stoutly they may 
set themselves against it, yet they shall be brought out of darkness 
into God’s marvellous light. It teaches us <i>the indispensable necessity of faith</i>; for even those who are given to Christ are not saved except they 
come to Jesus. Even <i>they</i> must come, for there is no other way to heaven but by the door, Christ 
Jesus. All that the Father gives to our Redeemer <i>must come to him</i>, therefore none can come to heaven except they come to Christ.</p>

will, but they “<i>shall come</i>.” The Lord Jesus doth by his messengers, his word, and his Spirit, 
sweetly and graciously compel men to come in that they may eat of 
his marriage supper; and this he does, not by any violation of the 
free agency of man, but by the power of his grace. I may exercise 
power over another man’s will, and yet that other man’s will may be perfectly free, because the constraint is exercised 
in a manner accordant with the laws of the human mind. Jehovah Jesus 
knows how, by irresistible arguments addressed to the understanding, 
by mighty reasons appealing to the affections, and by the mysterious 
influence of his Holy Spirit operating upon all the powers and passions 
of the soul, so to subdue the whole man, that whereas he was once 
rebellious, he yields cheerfully to his government, subdued by sovereign 
love. But how shall those be known whom God hath chosen? By this result: 
that they do willingly and joyfully accept Christ, and come to him 
with simple and unfeigned faith, resting upon him as all their salvation 
and all their desire. Reader, have you thus come to Jesus?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0730am-p3">It has been thought by some that as long as Peter lived, the fountain 
of his tears began to flow whenever he remembered his denying his 
Lord. It is not unlikely that it was so, for his sin was very great, 
and grace in him had afterwards a perfect work. This same experience 
is common to all the redeemed family according to the degree in which 
the Spirit of God has removed the natural heart of stone. We, like 
Peter, remember <i>our</i> <i>boastful promise</i>: “Though all men shall forsake thee, yet will not I.” We eat our own words with the bitter herbs of repentance. When we 
think of what we vowed we would be, and of what we have been, we may 
weep whole showers of grief. He thought on <i>his denying his Lord</i>. The place in which he did it, the little cause which led him into 
such heinous sin, the oaths and blasphemies with which he sought to 
confirm his falsehood, and the dreadful hardness of heart which drove 
him to do so again and yet again. Can we, when we are reminded of 
our sins, and their exceeding sinfulness, remain stolid and stubborn? 
Will we not make our house a Bochim, and cry unto the Lord for renewed 
assurances of pardoning love? May we never take a dry-eyed look at 
sin, lest ere long we have a tongue parched in the flames of hell. 
Peter also thought upon <i>his Master's</i> <i>look of love</i>. The Lord followed up the cock’s warning voice with an admonitory look of sorrow, pity, and love. 
That glance was never out of Peter’s mind so long as he lived. It was far more effectual than ten thousand 
sermons would have been without the Spirit. The penitent apostle would 
be sure to weep when he recollected the <i>Saviour’s full forgiveness</i>, which restored him to his former place. To think that we have offended 
so kind and good a Lord is more than sufficient reason for being constant 
weepers. Lord, smite our rocky hearts, and make the waters flow.</p>

he hath set before us an open door, let us not be slow to enter. This 
city of communion hath many pearly gates, every several gate is of 
one pearl, and each gate is thrown open to the uttermost that we may 
enter, assured of welcome. If there were but one small loophole through 
which to talk with Jesus, it would be a high privilege to thrust a 
word of fellowship through the narrow door; how much we are blessed

us, with many a stormy sea between, we should have longed to send 
a messenger to him to carry him our loves, and bring us tidings from 
his Father’s house; but see his kindness, he has built his house next door to

humble hearts, that so he may have perpetual intercourse with us. 
O how foolish must we be, if we do not live in habitual communion

<p class="normal" id="d0731pm-p3">Well was it so ordered in the temple that the sacred chant never ceased: 
for evermore did the singers praise the Lord, whose mercy endureth 
forever. As mercy did not cease to rule either by day or by night, 
so neither did music hush its holy ministry. My heart, there is a 
lesson sweetly taught to thee in the ceaseless song of Zion’s temple, thou too art a constant debtor, and see thou to it that 
thy gratitude, like charity, never faileth. God’s praise is constant in heaven, which is to be thy final dwelling-place, 
learn thou to practise the eternal hallelujah. Around the earth as 
the sun scatters his light, his beams awaken grateful believers to 
tune their morning hymn, so that by the priesthood of the saints perpetual 
praise is kept up at all hours, they swathe our globe in a mantle 
of thanksgiving, and girdle it with a golden belt of song.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0731pm-p4">The Lord always deserves to be praised for what he is in himself, 
for his works of creation and providence, for his goodness towards 
his creatures, and especially for the transcendent act of redemption, 
and all the marvellous blessing flowing therefrom. It is always beneficial 
to praise the Lord; it cheers the day and brightens the night; it 
lightens toil and softens sorrow; and over earthly gladness it sheds 
a sanctifying radiance which makes it less liable to blind us with 
its glare. Have we not something to sing about at this moment? Can 
we not weave a song out of our present joys, or our past deliverances, 
or our future hopes? Earth yields her summer fruits: the hay is housed, 
the golden grain invites the sickle, and the sun tarrying long to 
shine upon a fruitful earth, shortens the interval of shade that we 
may lengthen the hours of devout worship. By the love of Jesus, let 
us be stirred up to close the day with a psalm of sanctified gladness.</p>

field of promise. Here are abundance of precious promises, which exactly 
meet thy wants. Take this one: “He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.” Doth not that suit thy case? A reed, helpless, insignificant, and 
weak, a bruised reed, out of which no music can come; weaker than 
weakness itself; a reed, and that reed bruised, yet, he will not break 
thee; but on the contrary, will restore and strengthen thee. Thou 
art like the smoking flax: no light, no warmth, can come from thee; 
but he will not quench thee; he will blow with his sweet breath of 
mercy till he fans thee to a flame. Wouldst thou glean another ear? 
“Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest.” What soft words! Thy heart is tender, and the Master knows it, and 
therefore he speaketh so gently to thee. Wilt thou not obey him, and 
come to him even now? Take another ear of corn: “Fear not, thou worm Jacob, I will help thee, saith the Lord and thy 
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.” How canst thou fear with such a wonderful assurance as this? Thou 
mayest gather ten thousand such golden ears as these! “I have blotted out thy sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud thy 
transgressions.” Or this, “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though 
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” Or this, “The Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that is athirst come, 
and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely.” Our Master’s field is very rich; behold the handfuls. See, there they lie before 
thee, poor timid believer! Gather them up, make them thine own, for 
Jesus bids thee take them. Be not afraid, only believe! Grasp these 
sweet promises, thresh them out by meditation and feed on them with 
joy.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0801pm-p3">All the year round, every hour of every day, God is richly blessing 
us; both when we sleep and when we wake his mercy waits upon us. The 
sun may leave us a legacy of darkness, but our God never ceases to 
shine upon his children with beams of love. Like a river, his lovingkindness 
is always flowing, with a fulness inexhaustible as his own nature. 
Like the atmosphere which constantly surrounds the earth, and is always 
ready to support the life of man, the benevolence of God surrounds 
all his creatures; in it, as in their element, they live, and move, 
and have their being. Yet as the sun on summer days gladdens us with 
beams more warm and bright than at other times, and as rivers are 
at certain seasons swollen by the rain, and as the atmosphere itself 
is sometimes fraught with more fresh, more bracing, or more balmy 
influences than heretofore, so is it with the mercy of God; it hath 
its golden hours; its days of overflow, when the Lord magnifieth his 
grace before the sons of men. Amongst the blessings of the nether 
springs, <i>the joyous</i> <i>days of harvest</i> are a special season of excessive favour. It is the glory of autumn 
that the ripe gifts of providence are then abundantly bestowed; it 
is the mellow season of realization, whereas all before was but hope 
and expectation. Great is the joy of harvest. Happy are the reapers 
who fill their arms with the liberality of heaven. The Psalmist tells 
us that the harvest is the crowning of the year. Surely these crowning 
mercies call for crowning thanksgiving! Let us render it by the <i>inward emotions of gratitude</i>. Let our hearts be warmed; let our spirits remember, meditate, and 
think upon this goodness of the Lord. Then let us <i>praise him with our lips</i>, and laud and magnify his name from whose bounty all this goodness 
flows. Let us glorify God by yielding <i>our gifts</i> to his cause. A practical proof of our gratitude is a special thank-offering 
to the Lord of the harvest.</p>

the mountains of our grief in scales, and the hills of our tribulation

chance? No; he knows the end from the beginning. He sees in its appointed 
place, not merely the corner-stone which he has laid in fair colours,

<p class="normal" id="d0802pm-p3">Let me learn from Ruth, the gleaner. As she went out to gather the 
ears of corn, so must I go forth into the fields of prayer, meditation, 
the ordinances, and hearing the word to gather spiritual food. <i>The gleaner gathers her portion ear by</i> <i>ear</i>; her gains are little by little: so must I be content to search for 
single truths, if there be no greater plenty of them. Every ear helps 
to make a bundle, and every gospel lesson assists in making us wise 
unto salvation. <i>The gleaner keeps</i> <i>her eyes open</i>: if she stumbled among the stubble in a dream, she would have no 
load to carry home rejoicingly at eventide. I must be watchful in 
religious exercises lest they become unprofitable to me; I fear I 
have lost much already—O that I may rightly estimate my opportunities, and glean with greater 
diligence. <i>The gleaner stoops for all she finds</i>, and so must I. High spirits criticize and object, but lowly minds 
glean and receive benefit. A humble heart is a great help towards 
profitably hearing the gospel. The engrafted soul-saving word is not 
received except with meekness. A stiff back makes a bad gleaner; down, 
master pride, thou art a vile robber, not to be endured for a moment. 
<i>What the gleaner gathers she holds</i>: if she dropped one ear to find another, the result of her day’s work would be but scant; she is as careful to retain as to obtain, 
and so at last her gains are great. How often do I forget all that 
I hear; the second truth pushes the first out of my head, and so my 
reading and hearing end in much ado about nothing! Do I feel duly 
the importance of storing up the truth? A hungry belly makes the gleaner 
wise; if there be no corn in her hand, there will be no bread on her 
table; she labours under the sense of necessity, and hence her tread 
is nimble and her grasp is firm; I have even a greater necessity, 
Lord, help me to feel it, that it may urge me onward to glean in fields 
which yield so plenteous a reward to diligence.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0803am-p3">Quietly contemplate the Lamb as the light of heaven. Light in Scripture

us: we are here entirely through the Lord Jesus. Each one of these 
thoughts shall be to them like a cluster of the grapes of Eshcol. 
Light is also the cause of <i>beauty</i>. Nought of beauty is left when light is gone. Without light no radiance 
flashes from the sapphire, no peaceful ray proceedeth from the pearl; 
and thus all the beauty of the saints above comes from Jesus. As planets, 
they reflect the light of the Sun of Righteousness; they live as beams 
proceeding from the central orb. If he withdrew, they must die; if 
his glory were veiled, their glory must expire. Light is also the 
emblem of <i>knowledge</i>. In heaven our knowledge will be perfect, but the Lord Jesus himself 
will be the fountain of it. Dark providences, never understood before, 
will then be clearly seen, and all that puzzles us now will become 
plain to us in the light of the Lamb. Oh! what unfoldings there will 
be and what glorifying of the God of love! Light also means <i>manifestation</i>. Light manifests. In this world it doth not yet appear what we shall 
be. God’s people are a hidden people, but when Christ receives his people 
into heaven, he will touch them with the wand of his own love, and 
change them into the image of his manifested glory. They were poor 
and wretched, but what a transformation! They were stained with sin, 
but one touch of his finger, and they are bright as the sun, and clear 
as crystal. Oh! what a manifestation! All this proceeds from the exalted 
Lamb. Whatever there may be of effulgent splendour, Jesus shall be 
the centre and soul of it all. Oh! to be present and to see him in 
his own light, the King of kings, and Lord of lords!</p>

the ruler’s dead daughter; but he is so profuse in goodness that he works another 
miracle while upon the road. While yet this rod of Aaron bears the 
blossom of an unaccomplished wonder, it yields the ripe almonds of 
a perfect work of mercy. It is enough for us, if we have some one 
purpose, straightway to go and accomplish it; it were imprudent to 
expend our energies by the way. Hastening to the rescue of a drowning 
friend, we cannot afford to exhaust our strength upon another in like 
danger. It is enough for a tree to yield one sort of fruit, and for 
a man to fulfil his own peculiar calling. But our Master knows no 
limit of power or boundary of mission. He is so prolific of grace, 
that like the sun which shines as it rolls onward in its orbit, his 
path is radiant with lovingkindness. He is a swift arrow of love, 
which not only reaches its ordained target, but perfumes the air through 
which it flies. Virtue is evermore going out of Jesus, as sweet odours 
exhale from flowers; and it always will be emanating from him, as 
water from a sparkling fountain. What delightful encouragement this 
truth affords us! If our Lord is so ready to heal the sick and bless 
the needy, then, my soul, be not thou slow to put thyself in his way, 
that he may smile on thee. Be not slack in asking, if he be so abundant 
in bestowing. Give earnest heed to his word now, and at all times, 
that Jesus may speak through it to thy heart. Where he is to be found 
there make thy resort, that thou mayst obtain his blessing. When he 
is present to heal, may he not heal thee? But surely he is present 
even now, for he always comes to hearts which need him. And dost not 
thou need him? Ah, <i>he</i> knows how much! Thou Son of David, turn thine eye and look upon the 
distress which is now before thee, and make thy suppliant whole.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0804am-p3">Every believer understands that to know God is the highest and best 
form of knowledge; and this spiritual knowledge is a source of strength to the Christian. It strengthens his <i>faith</i>. Believers are constantly spoken of in the Scriptures as being persons 
who are enlightened and taught of the Lord; they are said to “have an unction from the Holy One,” and it is the Spirit’s peculiar office to lead them into all truth, and all this for the 
increase and the fostering of their faith. Knowledge strengthens <i>love</i>, as well as faith. Knowledge opens the door, and then through that 
door we see our Saviour. Or, to use another similitude, knowledge 
paints the portrait of Jesus, and when we see that portrait then we 
love him, we cannot love a Christ whom we do not know, at least, in 
some degree. If we know but little of the excellences of Jesus, what 
he has done for us, and what he is doing now, we cannot love him much; 
but the more we know him, the more we shall love him. Knowledge also 
strengthens <i>hope</i>. How can we hope for a thing if we do not know of its existence? 
Hope may be the telescope, but till we receive instruction, our ignorance 
stands in the front of the glass, and we can see nothing whatever; 
knowledge removes the interposing object, and when we look through 
the bright optic glass we discern the glory to be revealed, and anticipate 
it with joyous confidence. Knowledge supplies us reasons for <i>patience</i>. How shall we have patience unless we know something of the sympathy 
of Christ, and understand the good which is to come out of the correction 
which our heavenly Father sends us? Nor is there one single grace 
of the Christian which, under God, will not be fostered and brought 
to perfection by holy knowledge. How important, then, is it that we 
should grow not only in grace, but in the “knowledge” of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

right wisely are we taught to pray, “Give us this day our daily bread.” The curse is abroad; we have constant need of the blessing. When 
blight and mildew come they are chastisements from heaven, and men 
must learn to bear the rod, and him that hath appointed it.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0804pm-p4">Spiritually, mildew is no uncommon evil. When our work is most promising 
this blight appears. We hoped for many conversions, and lo! a general 
apathy, an abounding worldliness, or a cruel hardness of heart! There 
may be no open sin in those for whom we are labouring, but there is 
a deficiency of sincerity and decision sadly disappointing our desires. 
We learn from this our dependence upon the Lord, and the need of prayer 
that no blight may fall upon our work. Spiritual pride or sloth will 
soon bring upon us the dreadful evil, and only the Lord of the harvest 
can remove it. Mildew may even attack our own hearts, and shrivel 
our prayers and religious exercises. May it please the great Husbandman 
to avert so serious a calamity. Shine, blessed Sun of Righteousness, 
and drive the blights away.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0805am-p3">Upon some points a believer is absolutely sure. He knows, for instance, 
that God sits in the stern-sheets of the vessel when it rocks most. 
He believes that an invisible hand is always on the world’s tiller, and that wherever providence may drift, Jehovah steers it. 
That re-assuring knowledge prepares him for everything. He looks over 
the raging waters and sees the spirit of Jesus treading the billows, 
and he hears a voice saying, “It is I, be not afraid.” He knows too that God is always wise, and, knowing this, he is confident 
that there can be no accidents, no mistakes; that nothing can occur 
which ought not to arise. He can say, “If I should lose all I have, it is better that I should lose than 
have, if God so wills: the worst calamity is the wisest and the kindest 
thing that could befall to me if God ordains it.” “We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.” The Christian does not merely hold this as a theory, but <i>he knows it</i> as a matter of fact. Everything <i>has</i> worked for good as yet; the poisonous drugs mixed in fit proportions 
have worked the cure; the sharp cuts of the lancet have cleansed out 
the proud flesh and facilitated the healing. Every event as yet has 
worked out the most divinely blessed results; and so, believing that 
God rules all, that he governs wisely, that he brings good out of 
evil, the believer’s heart is assured, and he is enabled calmly to meet each trial as 
it comes. The believer can in the spirit of true resignation pray, 
“Send me what thou wilt, my God, so long as it comes from thee; never 
came there an ill portion from thy table to any of thy children.”</p>

been unbrotherly if they had claimed the land which had been conquered, 
and had left the rest of the people to fight for their portions alone. 
We have received much by means of the efforts and sufferings of the 
saints in years gone by, and if we do not make some return to the 
church of Christ by giving her our best energies, we are unworthy 
to be enrolled in her ranks. Others are combating the errors of the 
age manfully, or excavating perishing ones from amid the ruins of 
the fall, and if we fold our hands in idleness we had need be warned, 
lest the curse of Meroz fall upon us. The Master of the vineyard saith, 
“Why stand ye here all the day idle?” What is the idler’s excuse? Personal service of Jesus becomes all the more the duty 
of all because it is cheerfully and abundantly rendered by some. The 
toils of devoted missionaries and fervent ministers shame us if we 
sit still in indolence. Shrinking from trial is the temptation of 
those who are at ease in Zion: they would fain escape the cross and 
yet wear the crown; to them the question for this evening’s meditation is very applicable. If the most precious are tried in 
the fire, are we to escape the crucible? If the diamond must be vexed 
upon the wheel, are we to be made perfect without suffering? Who hath 
commanded the wind to cease from blowing because our bark is on the 
deep? Why and wherefore should we be treated better than our Lord? 
The firstborn felt the rod, and why not the younger brethren? It is 
a cowardly pride which would choose a downy pillow and a silken couch 
for a soldier of the cross. Wiser far is he who, being first resigned 
to the divine will, groweth by the energy of grace to be pleased with 
it, and so learns to gather lilies at the cross foot, and, like Samson, 
to find honey in the lion.</p>

superstition; it doth not exclude a single nation however barbarous. 
For the cannibal as well as for the civilized, for all climes and 
races this prayer is uttered: the whole circle of the earth it encompasses, 
and omits no son of Adam. We must be up and doing for our Master, 
or we cannot honestly offer such a prayer. The petition is not asked 
with a sincere heart unless we endeavour, as God shall help us, to 
extend the kingdom of our Master. Are there not some who <i>neglect</i> both to plead and to labour? Reader, is it <i>your</i> prayer? Turn your eyes to Calvary. Behold the Lord of Life nailed 
to a cross, with the thorn-crown about his brow, with bleeding head, 
and hands, and feet. What! can you look upon this miracle of miracles, 
the death of the Son of God, without feeling within your bosom a marvellous 
adoration that language never can express? And when you feel the blood 
applied to your conscience, and know that he has blotted out your 
sins, <i>you are not a man</i> unless you start from your knees and cry, “Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.” Can you bow before the Crucified in loving homage, and not wish to 
see your Monarch master of the world? Out on you if you can pretend 
to love your Prince, and desire not to see him the universal ruler. 
Your piety is worthless unless it leads you to wish that the same 
mercy which has been extended to you may bless the whole world. Lord,

<p class="normal" id="d0807am-p3">Believers love Jesus with a deeper affection than they dare to give 
to any other being. They would sooner lose father and mother than 
part with Christ. They hold all earthly comforts with a loose hand, 
but they carry him fast locked in their bosoms. They voluntarily deny 
themselves for his sake, but they are not to be driven to <i>deny</i> him. It is scant love which the fire of persecution can dry up; the 
true believer’s love is a deeper stream than this. Men have laboured to divide the 
faithful from their Master, but their attempts have been fruitless 
in every age. Neither crowns of honour, nor frowns of anger, have 
untied this more than Gordian knot. This is no every-day attachment 
which the world’s power may at length dissolve. Neither man nor devil have found a 
key which opens this lock. Never has the craft of Satan been more 
at fault than when he has exercised it in seeking to rend in sunder 
this union of two divinely welded hearts. It is written, and nothing 
can blot out the sentence, “<i>The upright love thee</i>.” The intensity of the love of the upright, however, is not so much 
to be judged by what it appears as by what the upright long for. It 
is our daily lament that we cannot love enough. Would that our hearts 
were capable of holding more, and reaching further. Like Samuel Rutherford, 
we sigh and cry, “Oh, for as much love as would go round about the earth, and over heaven—yea, the heaven of heavens, and ten thousand worlds—that I might let all out upon fair, fair, only fair Christ.” Alas! our longest reach is but a span of love, and our affection 
is but as a drop of a bucket compared with his deserts. Measure our 
love by our intentions, and it is high indeed; 'tis thus, we trust, 
our Lord doth judge of it. Oh, that we could give all the love in 
all hearts in one great mass, a gathering together of all loves to 
him who is altogether lovely!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0807pm-p3">Since the first hour in which goodness came into conflict with evil, 
it has never ceased to be true in spiritual experience, that Satan 
hinders us. From all points of the compass, all along the line of 
battle, in the vanguard and in the rear, at the dawn of day and in 
the midnight hour, Satan hinders us. If we toil in the field, he seeks 
to break the ploughshare; if we build the wall, he labours to cast 
down the stones; if we would serve God in suffering or in conflict—everywhere Satan hinders us. He hinders us when we are first coming 
to Jesus Christ. Fierce conflicts we had with Satan when we first 
looked to the cross and lived. Now that we are saved, he endeavours 
to hinder the completeness of our personal character. You may be congratulating 
yourself, “I have hitherto walked consistently; no man can challenge my integrity.” Beware of boasting, for your virtue will yet be tried; Satan will 
direct his engines against that very virtue for which you are the 
most famous. If you have been hitherto a firm believer, your faith 
will ere long be attacked; if you have been meek as Moses, expect 
to be tempted to speak unadvisedly with your lips. The birds will 
peck at your ripest fruit, and the wild boar will dash his tusks at 
your choicest vines. Satan is sure to hinder us when we are earnest 
in prayer. He checks our importunity, and weakens our faith in order 
that, if possible, we may miss the blessing. Nor is Satan less vigilant 
in obstructing Christian effort. There was never a revival of religion 
without a revival of his opposition. As soon as Ezra and Nehemiah 
begin to labour, Sanballat and Tobiah are stirred up to hinder them. 
What then? We are not alarmed because Satan hindereth us, for it is 
a proof that we are on the Lord’s side, and are doing the Lord’s work, and in his strength we shall win the victory, and triumph 
over our adversary.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0808am-p3">See the spider’s web, and behold in it a most suggestive picture of the hypocrite’s religion. <i>It is meant to catch his</i> <i>prey</i>: the spider fattens himself on flies, and the Pharisee has his reward. 
Foolish persons are easily entrapped by the loud professions of pretenders, 
and even the more judicious cannot always escape. Philip baptized 
Simon Magus, whose guileful declaration of faith was so soon exploded 
by the stern rebuke of Peter. Custom, reputation, praise, advancement, 
and other flies, are the small game which hypocrites take in their 
nets. A spider’s web is <i>a marvel of skill</i>: look at it and admire the cunning hunter’s wiles. Is not a deceiver’s religion equally wonderful? How does he make so barefaced a lie 
appear to be a truth? How can he make his tinsel answer so well the 
purpose of gold? A spider’s web <i>comes all from the creature’s own</i> <i>bowels</i>. The bee gathers her wax from flowers, the spider sucks no flowers, 
and yet she spins out her material to any length. Even so hypocrites 
find their trust and hope within themselves; their anchor was forged 
on their own anvil, and their cable twisted by their own hands. They 
lay their own foundation, and hew out the pillars of their own house, 
disdaining to be debtors to the sovereign grace of God. But a spider’s web is <i>very frail</i>. It is curiously wrought, but not enduringly manufactured. It is 
no match for the servant’s broom, or the traveller’s staff. The hypocrite needs no battery of Armstrongs to blow his 
hope to pieces, a mere puff of wind will do it. Hypocritical cobwebs 
will soon come down when the besom of destruction begins its purifying 
work. Which reminds us of one more thought, viz., that such cobwebs 
<i>are not to be</i> <i>endured in the Lord’s house</i>: he will see to it that they and those who spin them shall be destroyed 
forever. O my soul, be thou resting on something better than a spider’s web. Be the Lord Jesus thine eternal hiding-place.</p>

forlornly think that this is the necessary state of believers. This 
is a mistake, for “all things are possible to him that believeth”; and it is possible for us to mount into a state in which a doubt 
or a fear shall be but as a bird of passage flitting across the soul, 
but never lingering there. When you read of the high and sweet communions 
enjoyed by favoured saints, you sigh and murmur in the chamber of 
your heart, “Alas! these are not for me.” O climber, if thou hast but faith, thou shalt yet stand upon the 
sunny pinnacle of the temple, for “all things are possible to him that believeth.” You hear of exploits which holy men have done for Jesus; what they 
have enjoyed of him; how much they have been like him; how they have 
been able to endure great persecutions for his sake; and you say, 
“Ah! as for me, I am but a worm; I can never attain to this.” But there is nothing which one saint was, that you may not be. There 
is no elevation of grace, no attainment of spirituality, no clearness 
of assurance, no post of duty, which is not open to you if you have 
but the power to believe. Lay aside your sackcloth and ashes, and 
rise to the dignity of your true position; you are little in Israel 
because you will be so, not because there is any necessity for it. 
It is not meet that thou shouldst grovel in the dust, O child of a 
King. Ascend! The golden throne of assurance is waiting for you! The 
crown of communion with Jesus is ready to bedeck your brow. Wrap yourself 
in scarlet and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day; for if 
thou believest, thou mayst eat the fat of kidneys of wheat; thy land 
shall flow with milk and honey, and thy soul shall be satisfied as 
with marrow and fatness. Gather golden sheaves of grace, for they 
await thee in the fields of faith. <i>“All things are possible to him that believeth.”</i></p>

alone. Here we must have the help of our companions, but there they 
find all they want in Christ Jesus. Here we look to the meat which 
perisheth, and to the raiment which decays before the moth, but there 
they find everything in God. We use the bucket to fetch us water from 
the well, but there they drink from the fountain head, and put their 
lips down to the living water. Here the angels bring us blessings, 
but we shall want no messengers from heaven then. They shall need 
no Gabriels there to bring their love-notes from God, for there they 
shall see <i>him</i> face to face. Oh! what a blessed time shall that be when we shall 
have mounted above every second cause and shall rest upon the bare 
arm of God! What a glorious hour when God, and not his creatures; 
the Lord, and not his works, shall be our daily joy! Our souls shall 
then have attained the perfection of bliss.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0809pm-p3">Mary of Magdala was <i>the victim of a fearful evil</i>. She was possessed by not one devil only, but seven. These dreadful 
inmates caused much pain and pollution to the poor frame in which 
they had found a lodging. Hers was a hopeless, horrible case. She 
could not help herself, neither could any human succour avail. But 
Jesus passed that way, and unsought, and probably even resisted by 
the poor demoniac, he uttered the word of power, and Mary of Magdala 
became <i>a trophy of the healing</i> <i>power of Jesus</i>. All the seven demons left her, left her never to return, forcibly 
ejected by the Lord of all. What a blessed deliverance! What a happy 
change! From delirium to delight, from despair to peace, from hell 
to heaven! Straightway she became <i>a constant follower of Jesus</i>, catching his every word, following his devious steps, sharing his 
toilsome life; and withal she became <i>his generous helper</i>, first among that band of healed and grateful women who ministered 
unto him of their substance. When Jesus was lifted up in crucifixion, 
Mary remained <i>the sharer of his shame</i>: we find her first beholding from afar, and then drawing near to 
the foot of the cross. She could not die on the cross with Jesus, 
but she stood as near it as she could, and when his blessed body was 
taken down, she watched to see how and where it was laid. She was 
<i>the faithful and watchful believer</i>, last at the sepulchre where Jesus slept, first at the grave whence 
he arose. Her holy fidelity made her <i>a favoured beholder of her beloved</i> <i>Rabboni</i>, who deigned to call her by her name, and to make her <i>his messenger of good news</i> to the trembling disciples and Peter. Thus grace found her a maniac 
and made her a minister, cast out devils and gave her to behold angels, 
delivered her from Satan, and united her forever to the Lord Jesus. 
May I also be such a miracle of grace!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0810am-p3">Paul’s marvellously rich expression indicates, that Christ is the <i>source</i> of our life. “You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins.” That same voice which brought Lazarus out of the tomb raised us to 
newness of life. He is now the <i>substance</i> of our spiritual life. It is by his life that we live; he is in us, 
the hope of glory, the spring of our actions, the central thought 
which moves every other thought. <i>Christ is</i> <i>the sustenance of our life</i>. What can the Christian feed upon but Jesus’ flesh and blood? “This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat 
thereof, and not die.” O wayworn pilgrims in this wilderness of sin, you never get a morsel 
to satisfy the hunger of your spirits, except ye find it in him! <i>Christ is the solace of our life</i>. All our true joys come from him; and in times of trouble, his presence 
is our consolation. There is nothing worth living for but him; and 
his lovingkindness is better than life! <i>Christ is the object of</i> <i>our life</i>. As speeds the ship towards the port, so hastes the believer towards 
the haven of his Saviour’s bosom. As flies the arrow to its goal, so flies the Christian towards 
the perfecting of his fellowship with Christ Jesus. As the soldier 
fights for his captain, and is crowned in his captain’s victory, so the believer contends for Christ, and gets his triumph 
out of the triumphs of his Master. “For him to live is Christ.” <i>Christ is</i> <i>the exemplar of our life</i>. Where there is the same life within, there will, there must be, 
to a great extent, the same developments without; and if we live in 
near fellowship with the Lord Jesus we shall grow like him. We shall 
set him before us as our Divine copy, and we shall seek to tread in 
his footsteps, until he shall become <i>the crown of our life in glory</i>. Oh! how safe, how honoured, how happy is the Christian, since Christ 
is our life!</p>

below, before the ransom had been paid, before the blood had been 
literally sprinkled on the mercy-seat, he had power to forgive sin. 
Hath he not power to do it now that he hath died? What power must 
dwell in him who to the utmost farthing has faithfully discharged 
the debts of his people! He has boundless power now that he has finished 
transgression and made an end of sin. If ye doubt it, see him rising

to his wounds, urging the merit of his sacred passion! What power 
to forgive is here! “He hath ascended on high, and received gifts for men.” “He is exalted on high to give repentance and remission of sins.” The most crimson sins are removed by the crimson of his blood. At 
this moment, dear reader, whatever thy sinfulness, Christ has power 
to pardon, power to pardon <i>thee</i>, and millions such as thou art. A word will speak it. He has nothing 
more to do to win thy pardon; all the atoning work is done. He can, 
in answer to thy tears, forgive thy sins today, and make thee know 
it. He can breathe into thy soul at this very moment a peace with 
God which passeth all understanding, which shall spring from perfect 
remission of thy manifold iniquities. Dost thou believe that? I trust 
thou believest it. Mayst thou experience now the power of Jesus to

<p class="normal" id="d0811am-p3">Numbers of Christians can view the past with pleasure, but regard 
the present with dissatisfaction; they look back upon the days which 
they have passed in communing with the Lord as being the sweetest 
and the best they have ever known, but as to the present, it is clad 
in a sable garb of gloom and dreariness. Once they lived near to Jesus, 
but now they feel that they have wandered from him, and they say, 
“O that I were as in months past!” They complain that they have lost their evidences, or that they have 
not present peace of mind, or that they have no enjoyment in the means 
of grace, or that conscience is not so tender, or that they have not 
so much zeal for God’s glory. The causes of this mournful state of things are manifold. 
It may arise through a comparative <i>neglect of prayer</i>, for a neglected closet is the beginning of all spiritual decline. 
Or it may be the result of <i>idolatry</i>. The heart has been occupied with something else, more than with 
God; the affections have been set on the things of earth, instead 
of the things of heaven. A jealous God will not be content with a 
divided heart; he must be loved first and best. He will withdraw the 
sunshine of his presence from a cold, wandering heart. Or the cause 
may be found in <i>self-confidence</i> and <i>self-righteousness</i>. Pride is busy in the heart, and self is exalted instead of lying 
low at the foot of the cross. Christian, if you are not now as you 
“were in months past,” do not rest satisfied with <i>wishing</i> for a return of former happiness, but go at once to seek your Master, 
and tell him your sad state. Ask his grace and strength to help you 
to walk more closely with him; humble yourself before him, and he 
will lift you up, and give you yet again to enjoy the light of his 
countenance. Do not sit down to sigh and lament; while the beloved 
Physician lives there is hope, nay there is a certainty of recovery 
for the worst cases.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0811pm-p3">“Consolation.” There is music in the word: like David’s harp, it charms away the evil spirit of melancholy. It was a distinguished 
honour to Barnabas to be called “the son of consolation”; nay, it is one of the illustrious names of a greater than Barnabas, 
for the Lord Jesus is “the consolation of Israel.” “<i>Everlasting</i> consolation”—here is the cream of all, for the eternity of comfort is the crown 
and glory of it. What is this “everlasting consolation”? It includes a sense of pardoned sin. A Christian man has received 
in his heart the witness of the Spirit that his iniquities are put 
away like a cloud, and his transgressions like a thick cloud. If sin 
be pardoned, is not that an everlasting consolation? Next, the Lord 
gives his people an abiding sense of acceptance in Christ. The Christian 
knows that God looks upon him as standing in union with Jesus. Union 
to the risen Lord is a consolation of the most abiding order; it is, 
in fact, everlasting. Let sickness prostrate us, have we not seen 
hundreds of believers as happy in the weakness of disease as they 
would have been in the strength of hale and blooming health? Let death’s arrows pierce us to the heart, our comfort dies not, for have not 
our ears full often heard the songs of saints as they have rejoiced 
because the living love of God was shed abroad in their hearts in 
dying moments? Yes, a sense of acceptance in the Beloved is an everlasting 
consolation. Moreover, the Christian has a conviction of his security. 
God has promised to save those who trust in Christ: the Christian 
does trust in Christ, and he believes that God will be as good as 
his word, and will save him. He feels that he is safe by virtue of 
his being bound up with the person and work of Jesus.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0812pm-p3">The rainbow, the symbol of the covenant with Noah, is typical of our 
Lord Jesus, who is the Lord’s witness to the people. When may we <i>expect to see the token of the covenant</i>? The rainbow is only to be seen painted upon a <i>cloud</i>. When the sinner’s conscience is dark with clouds, when he remembers his past sin, 
and mourneth and lamenteth before God, Jesus Christ is revealed to 
him as the covenant Rainbow, displaying all the glorious hues of the 
divine character and betokening peace. To the believer, when his trials 
and temptations surround him, it is sweet to behold the person of 
our Lord Jesus Christ—to see him bleeding, living, rising, and pleading for us. God’s rainbow is hung over the cloud of our sins, our sorrows, and our 
woes, to prophesy deliverance. Nor does a <i>cloud</i> alone give a rainbow, there must be <i>the crystal drops</i> to reflect the light of the sun. So, our sorrows must not only threaten, 
but they must really fall upon us. There had been no Christ for us 
if the vengeance of God had been merely a threatening cloud: punishment 
must fall in terrible drops upon the Surety. Until there is a <i>real</i> anguish in the sinner’s conscience, there is no Christ for him; until the chastisement which 
he feels becomes grievous, he cannot see Jesus. But there must also 
be a sun; for clouds and drops of rain make not rainbows unless the 
sun shineth. Beloved, our God, who is as the sun to us, always shines, 
but we do not always see him—clouds hide his face; but no matter what drops may be falling, or 
what clouds may be threatening, if <i>he</i> does but shine there will be a rainbow at once. It is said that when 
we see the rainbow the shower is over. Certain it is, that when Christ 
comes, our troubles remove; when we behold Jesus, our sins vanish, 
and our doubts and fears subside. When Jesus walks the waters of the 
sea, how profound the calm!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0813am-p3">Lebanon’s cedars are emblematic of the Christian, in that <i>they owe their planting entirely to the Lord</i>. This is quite true of every child of God. He is not man-planted, 
nor self-planted, but God-planted. The mysterious hand of the divine 
Spirit dropped the living seed into a heart which he had himself prepared 
for its reception. Every true heir of heaven owns the great Husbandman 
as his planter. Moreover, the cedars of Lebanon <i>are not dependent upon man for their watering</i>; they stand on the lofty rock, unmoistened by human irrigation; and 
yet our heavenly Father supplieth them. Thus it is with the Christian 
who has learned to live by faith. He is independent of man, even in 
temporal things; for his continued maintenance he looks to the Lord 
his God, and to him alone. The dew of heaven is his portion, and the 
God of heaven is his fountain. Again, the cedars of Lebanon <i>are not protected by any mortal power</i>. They owe nothing to man for their preservation from stormy wind 
and tempest. They are God’s trees, kept and preserved by him, and by him alone. It is precisely 
the same with the Christian. He is not a hot-house plant, sheltered 
from temptation; he stands in the most exposed position; he has no 
shelter, no protection, except this, that the broad wings of the eternal 
God always cover the cedars which he himself has planted. Like cedars, 
believers are <i>full of sap,</i> having vitality enough to be ever green, even amid winter’s snows. Lastly, the flourishing and majestic condition of the cedar 
<i>is to the</i> <i>praise of God only</i>. The Lord, even the Lord alone hath been everything unto the cedars, 
and, therefore David very sweetly puts it in one of the psalms, “Praise ye the Lord, fruitful trees and all cedars.” In the believer there is nothing that can magnify man; he is planted, 
nourished, and protected by the Lord’s own hand, and to him let all the glory be ascribed.</p>

strength. Even the <i>remembrance</i> of the covenant is not left to our memories, for <i>we</i> might forget, but our Lord cannot forget the saints whom he has graven 
on the palms of his hands. It is with us as with Israel in Egypt; 
the blood was upon the lintel and the two side-posts, but the Lord 
did not say, “When <i>you</i> see the blood I will pass over you,” but “When <i>I</i> see the blood I will pass over you.” My looking to Jesus brings me joy and peace, but it is God’s looking to Jesus which secures my salvation and that of all his 
elect, since it is impossible for our God to look at Christ, our bleeding 
Surety, and then to be angry with us for sins already punished in 
him. No, it is not left with <i>us</i> even to be saved by remembering the covenant. There is no linsey-wolsey 
here—not a single thread of the creature mars the fabric. It is not <i>of</i> man, neither <i>by</i> man, but of the Lord alone. We <i>should</i> remember the covenant, and we <i>shall</i> do it, through divine grace; but the hinge of our safety does not 
hang there—it is God’s remembering <i>us</i>, not our remembering <i>him</i>; and hence the covenant is <i>an everlasting covenant</i>.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0814am-p3">Do you believe that your sins are forgiven, and that Christ has made 
a full atonement for them? Then what a joyful Christian <i>you ought to be</i>! How you should live above the common trials and troubles of the 
world! Since sin is forgiven, can it matter what happens to you now? 
Luther said, “Smite, Lord, smite, for my sin is forgiven; if thou hast but forgiven 
me, smite as hard as thou wilt;” and in a similar spirit you may say, “Send sickness, poverty, losses, crosses, persecution, what thou wilt, 
<i>thou hast forgiven me</i>, and my soul is glad.” Christian, if thou art thus saved, whilst thou art glad, <i>be grateful and</i> <i>loving</i>. Cling to that cross which took thy sin away; serve thou him who 
served thee. “I beseech you therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present your 
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your 
reasonable service.” Let not your zeal evaporate in some little ebullition of song. Show 
your love in expressive tokens. Love the brethren of him who loved 
you. If there be a Mephibosheth anywhere who is lame or halt, help 
him for Jonathan’s sake. If there be a poor tried believer, weep with him, and bear 
his cross for the sake of him who wept for thee and carried thy sins. 
Since thou art thus forgiven freely for Christ’s sake, go and tell to others the joyful news of pardoning mercy. 
Be not contented with this unspeakable blessing for thyself alone, 
but publish abroad the story of the cross. Holy gladness and holy 
boldness will make you a good preacher, and all the world will be 
a pulpit for you to preach in. Cheerful holiness is the most forcible 
of sermons, but the Lord must give it you. Seek it this morning before 
you go into the world. When it is the Lord’s work in which we rejoice, we need not be afraid of being too glad.</p>

Hush, thou silly, fluttering heart, prying, peeping, and suspecting! 
What thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter, and meanwhile 
Jesus, the beloved Physician, knows thy soul in adversities. Why need 
the patient analyze all the medicine, or estimate all the symptoms? 
This is the Physician’s work, not mine; it is my business to trust, and his to prescribe. 
If he shall write his prescription in uncouth characters which I cannot

skill to make all plain in the result, however mysterious in the working.</p>

for it every intellectual office? Here, then, must the believer rest 
his comfort in sickness, not that he himself can see the end, but 
that Jesus knows all. Sweet Lord, be thou forever eye, and soul, and 
head for us, and let us be content to know only what thou choosest

<p class="normal" id="d0815am-p3"><i>Very admirable was his occupation</i>. If those who spend so many hours in idle company, light reading, 
and useless pastimes, could learn wisdom, they would find more profitable 
society and more interesting engagements in meditation than in the 
vanities which now have such charms for them. We should all know more, 
live nearer to God, and grow in grace, if we were more alone. Meditation 
chews the cud and extracts the real nutriment from the mental food 
gathered elsewhere. When Jesus is the theme, meditation is sweet indeed. 
Isaac found Rebecca while engaged in private musings; many others 
have found their best beloved there.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0815am-p4"><i>Very admirable was the choice of place</i>. In the field we have a study hung round with texts for thought. 
From the cedar to the hyssop, from the soaring eagle down to the chirping 
grasshopper, from the blue expanse of heaven to a drop of dew, all 
things are full of teaching, and when the eye is divinely opened, 
that teaching flashes upon the mind far more vividly than from written 
books. Our little rooms are neither so healthy, so suggestive, so 
agreeable, or so inspiring as the fields. Let us count nothing common 
or unclean, but feel that all created things point to their Maker, 
and the field will at once be hallowed.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0815am-p5"><i>Very admirable was the season</i>. The season of sunset as it draws a veil over the day, befits that 
repose of the soul when earthborn cares yield to the joys of heavenly

solemnity of approaching night awakens our awe. If the business of 
this day will permit it, it will be well, dear reader, if you can 
spare an hour to walk in the field at eventide, but if not, the Lord 
is in the town too, and will meet with thee in thy chamber or in the 
crowded street. Let thy heart go forth to meet him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0815pm-p3">A heart of flesh is known by its <i>tenderness concerning</i> <i>sin</i>. To have indulged a foul imagination, or to have allowed a wild desire 
to tarry even for a moment, is quite enough to make a heart of flesh 
grieve before the Lord. The heart of stone calls a great iniquity 
nothing, but not so the heart of flesh.</p>

</verse>
<p class="normal" id="d0815pm-p4">The heart of flesh is <i>tender of God’s will</i>. My Lord Will-be-will is a great blusterer, and it is hard to subject 
him to God’s will; but when the heart of flesh is given, the will quivers like 
an aspen leaf in every breath of heaven, and bows like an osier in 
every breeze of God’s Spirit. The natural will is cold, hard iron, which is not to be 
hammered into form, but the renewed will, like molten metal, is soon 
moulded by the hand of grace. In the fleshy heart there is <i>a tenderness of the</i> <i>affections</i>. The hard heart does not love the Redeemer, but the renewed heart 
burns with affection towards him. The hard heart is selfish and coldly 
demands, “Why should I weep for sin? Why should I love the Lord?” But the heart of flesh says; “Lord, thou knowest that I love thee; help me to love thee more!” Many are the privileges of this renewed heart; “'Tis here the Spirit dwells, 'tis here that Jesus rests.” It is fitted to receive every spiritual blessing, and every blessing 
comes to it. It is prepared to yield every heavenly fruit to the honour 
and praise of God, and therefore the Lord delights in it. A tender 
heart is the best defence against sin, and the best preparation for 
heaven. A renewed heart stands on its watchtower looking for the coming 
of the Lord Jesus. Have you this heart of flesh?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0816am-p3">God’s glory is the result of his nature and acts. He is glorious in his 
character, for there is such a store of everything that is holy, and 
good, and lovely in God, that he must be glorious. The actions which 
flow from his character are also glorious; but while he intends that 
they should manifest to his creatures his goodness, and mercy, and 
justice, he is equally concerned that the glory associated with them 
should be given only to himself. Nor is there aught in ourselves in 
which we may glory; for who maketh us to differ from another? And 
what have we that we did not receive from the God of all grace? Then 
how careful ought we to be to <i>walk humbly before the Lord</i>! The moment we glorify ourselves, since there is room for one glory 
only in the universe, we set ourselves up as rivals to the Most High. 
Shall the insect of an hour glorify itself against the sun which warmed 
it into life? Shall the potsherd exalt itself above the man who fashioned it upon the wheel? Shall 
the dust of the desert strive with the whirlwind? Or the drops of 
the ocean struggle with the tempest? Give unto the Lord, all ye righteous, 
give unto the Lord glory and strength; give unto him the honour that 
is due unto his name. Yet it is, perhaps, one of the hardest struggles 
of the Christian life to learn this sentence—“Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be glory.” It is a lesson which God is ever teaching us, and teaching us sometimes 
by most painful discipline. Let a Christian begin to boast, “I can do all things,” without adding “through Christ which strengtheneth me,” and before long he will have to groan, “I can do nothing,” and bemoan himself in the dust. When we do anything for the Lord, 
and he is pleased to accept of our doings, let us lay our crown at 
his feet, and exclaim, “Not I, but the grace of God which was with me!”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0816pm-p3">Present possession is declared. At this present moment we have the 
first fruits of the Spirit. We have repentance, that gem of the first 
water; faith, that priceless pearl; hope, the heavenly emerald; and 
love, the glorious ruby. We are already made “new creatures in Christ Jesus,” by the effectual working of God the Holy Ghost. This is called the 
firstfruit because <i>it comes first</i>. As the wave-sheaf was the first of the harvest, so the spiritual 
life, and all the graces which adorn that life, are the first operations 
of the Spirit of God in our souls. <i>The firstfruits were the pledge of the harvest</i>. As soon as the Israelite had plucked the first handful of ripe ears, 
he looked forward with glad anticipation to the time when the wain 
should creak beneath the sheaves. So, brethren, when God gives us 
things which are pure, lovely, and of good report, as the work of 
the Holy Spirit, these are to us the prognostics of the coming glory. 
<i>The firstfruits were always holy to the</i> <i>Lord</i>, and our new nature, with all its powers, is a consecrated thing. 
The new life is not ours that we should ascribe its excellence to 
our own merit; it is Christ’s image and creation, and is ordained for his glory. But <i>the</i> <i>firstfruits were not the harvest</i>, and the works of the Spirit in us at this moment are not the consummation—the perfection is yet to come. We must not boast that we have attained, 
and so reckon the wave-sheaf to be all the produce of the year: we 
must hunger and thirst after righteousness, and pant for the day of 
full redemption. Dear reader, this evening open your mouth wide, and 
God will fill it. Let the boon in present possession excite in you 
a sacred avarice for more grace. Groan within yourself for higher 
degrees of consecration, and your Lord will grant them to you, for 
he is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or even think.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0817am-p3">Meditate a little on this mercy of the Lord. It is <i>tender</i> <i>mercy</i>. With gentle, loving touch, he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth 
up their wounds. He is as gracious in the manner of his mercy as in 
the matter of it. It is <i>great</i> <i>mercy</i>. There is nothing little in God; his mercy is like himself—it is infinite. You cannot measure it. His mercy is so great that 
it forgives great sins to great sinners, after great lengths of time, 
and then gives great favours and great privileges, and raises us up 
to great enjoyments in the great heaven of the great God. It is <i>undeserved mercy</i>, as indeed all true mercy must be, for deserved mercy is only a misnomer 
for justice. There was no right on the sinner’s part to the kind consideration of the Most High; had the rebel been 
doomed at once to eternal fire he would have richly merited the doom, 
and if delivered from wrath, sovereign love alone has found a cause, 
for there was none in the sinner himself. It is <i>rich mercy</i>. Some things are great, but have little efficacy in them, but this 
mercy is a cordial to your drooping spirits; a golden ointment to 
your bleeding wounds; a heavenly bandage to your broken bones; a royal 
chariot for your weary feet; a bosom of love for your trembling heart. 
It is <i>manifold mercy</i>. As Bunyan says, “All the flowers in God’s garden are double.” There is no single mercy. You may think you have but one mercy, but 
you shall find it to be a whole cluster of mercies. It is <i>abounding mercy</i>. Millions have received it, yet far from its being exhausted; it 
is as fresh, as full, and as free as ever. <i>It is unfailing mercy</i>. It will never leave thee. If mercy be thy friend, mercy will be 
with thee in temptation to keep thee from yielding; with thee in trouble 
to prevent thee from sinking; with thee living to be the light and 
life of thy countenance; and with thee dying to be the joy of thy 
soul when earthly comfort is ebbing fast.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0817pm-p3">From our Lord’s words we learn that there is a limit to sickness. Here is an “unto” within which its ultimate end is restrained, and beyond which it 
cannot go. Lazarus might pass through death, but death was not to 
be the ultimatum of his sickness. In all sickness, the Lord saith 
to the waves of pain, “Hitherto shall ye go, but no further.” His fixed purpose is not the destruction, but the instruction of 
his people. Wisdom hangs up the thermometer at the furnace mouth, 
and regulates the heat.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0817pm-p4">1. <i>The limit is encouragingly comprehensive</i>. The God of providence has limited the time, manner, intensity, repetition, 
and effects of all our sicknesses; each throb is decreed, each sleepless 
hour predestinated, each relapse ordained, each depression of spirit 
foreknown, and each sanctifying result eternally purposed. Nothing 
great or small escapes the ordaining hand of him who numbers the hairs 
of our head.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0817pm-p5">2. <i>This limit is wisely adjusted</i> to our strength, to the end designed, and to the grace apportioned. 
Affliction comes not at haphazard—the weight of every stroke of the rod is accurately measured. He who 
made no mistakes in balancing the clouds and meting out the heavens, 
commits no errors in measuring out the ingredients which compose the 
medicine of souls. We cannot suffer too much nor be relieved too late.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0817pm-p6">3. <i>The limit is tenderly appointed</i>. The knife of the heavenly Surgeon never cuts deeper than is absolutely 
necessary. “He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.” A mother’s heart cries, “Spare my child;” but no mother is more compassionate than our gracious God. When we 
consider how hard-mouthed we are, it is a wonder that we are not driven 
with a sharper bit. The thought is full of consolation, that he who 
has fixed the bounds of our habitation, has also fixed the bounds 
of our tribulation.</p>

of discipline. If the thousands who will read this portion shall all 
take this matter before the Lord Jesus this day, he will interfere

the Church is to pollute a well, to pour water upon fire, to sow a

<p class="normal" id="d0818am-p4">Our zeal must, however, begin at home. Let us examine <i>ourselves</i> as to our right to eat at the Lord’s table. Let us see to it that we have on our wedding garment, lest 
we ourselves be intruders in the Lord’s sanctuaries. Many are called, but few are chosen; the way is narrow, 
and the gate is strait. O for grace to come to Jesus aright, with 
the faith of God’s elect. He who smote Uzzah for touching the ark is very jealous of 
his two ordinances; as a true believer I may approach them freely, 
as an alien I must not touch them lest I die. Heart searching is the 
duty of all who are baptized or come to the Lord’s table. <i>“Search me, O God, and know my way, try me and know my</i> <i>heart.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d0818pm-p3">A golden truth is couched in the fact that the Saviour put the myrrhed 
wine-cup from his lips. On the heights of heaven the Son of God stood 
of old, and as he looked down upon our globe he measured the long 
descent to the utmost depths of human misery; he cast up the sum total 
of all the agonies which expiation would require, and abated not a 
jot. He solemnly determined that to offer a sufficient atoning sacrifice 
he must go the whole way, from the highest to the lowest, from the 
throne of highest glory to the cross of deepest woe. This myrrhed 
cup, with its soporific influence, would have stayed him within a 
little of the utmost limit of misery, therefore he refused it. He 
would not stop short of all he had undertaken to suffer for his people. 
Ah, how many of us have pined after reliefs to our grief which would 
have been injurious to us! Reader, did you never pray for a discharge 
from hard service or suffering with a petulant and wilful eagerness? 
Providence has taken from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke. 
Say, Christian, if it had been said, “If you so desire it, that loved one of yours shall live, but God will 
be dishonoured,” could you have put away the temptation, and said, “Thy will be done”? Oh, it is sweet to be able to say, “My Lord, if for other reasons I need not suffer, yet if I can honour 
thee more by suffering, and if the loss of my earthly all will bring 
thee glory, then so let it be. I refuse the comfort, if it comes in 
the way of thine honour.” O that we thus walked more in the footsteps of our Lord, cheerfully 
enduring trial for his sake, promptly and willingly putting away the 
thought of self and comfort when it would interfere with our finishing 
the work which he has given us to do. Great grace is needed, but great 
grace is provided.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0819am-p3">Christ’s reign in his Church is that of a <i>shepherd-king</i>. He has supremacy, but it is the superiority of a wise and tender 
shepherd over his needy and loving flock; he commands and receives 
obedience, but it is the willing obedience of the well-cared-for sheep, 
rendered joyfully to their beloved Shepherd, whose voice they know 
so well. He rules by the force of love and the energy of goodness.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0819am-p4">His reign is <i>practical in its character</i>. It is said, “He shall <i>stand and feed</i>.” The great Head of the Church is actively engaged in providing for 
his people. He does not sit down upon the throne in empty state, or 
hold a sceptre without wielding it in government. No, he stands and 
feeds. The expression “feed,” in the original, is like an analogous one in the Greek, which means 
to shepherdize, to do everything expected of a shepherd: to guide, 
to watch, to preserve, to restore, to tend, as well as to feed.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0819am-p5">His reign is <i>continual in its duration</i>. It is said, “<i>He</i> <i>shall stand</i> and feed;” not “He shall feed now and then, and leave his position;” not, “He shall one day grant a revival, and then next day leave his Church 
to barrenness.” His eyes never slumber, and his hands never rest; his heart never 
ceases to beat with love, and his shoulders are never weary of carrying 
his people’s burdens.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0819am-p6">His reign is <i>effectually powerful in its action</i>; “He shall feed in the strength of Jehovah.” Wherever Christ is, there is God; and whatever Christ does is the 
act of the Most High. Oh! it is a joyful truth to consider that he 
who stands today representing the interests of his people is very 
God of very God, to whom every knee shall bow. Happy are we who belong 
to such a shepherd, whose humanity communes with us, and whose divinity 
protects us. Let us worship and bow down before him as the people 
of his pasture.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0819pm-p3">Our spiritual foes are of the serpent’s brood, and seek to ensnare us by subtlety. The prayer before us 
supposes the possibility of the believer being caught like a bird. 
So deftly does the fowler do his work, that simple ones are soon surrounded 
by the net. The text asks that even out of Satan’s meshes the captive one may be delivered; this is a proper petition, 
and one which can be granted: from between the jaws of the lion, and 
out of the belly of hell, can eternal love rescue the saint. It may 
need a sharp pull to save a soul from the net of temptations, and 
a mighty pull to extricate a man from the snares of malicious cunning, 
but the Lord is equal to every emergency, and the most skilfully placed 
nets of the hunter shall never be able to hold his chosen ones. Woe 
unto those who are so clever at net laying; they who tempt others 
shall be destroyed themselves.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0819pm-p4">“<i>For thou art my strength</i>.” What an inexpressible sweetness is to be found in these few words! 
How joyfully may we encounter toils, and how cheerfully may we endure 
sufferings, when we can lay hold upon celestial strength. Divine power 
will rend asunder all the toils of our enemies, confound their politics, 
and frustrate their knavish tricks; he is a happy man who has such 
matchless might engaged upon his side. Our own strength would be of 
little service when embarrassed in the nets of base cunning, but the 
Lord’s strength is ever available; we have but to invoke it, and we shall 
find it near at hand. If by faith we are depending alone upon the 
strength of the mighty God of Israel, we may use our holy reliance 
as a plea in supplication.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0820am-p3">Among all the saints whose lives are recorded in Holy Writ, David 
possesses an experience of the most striking, varied, and instructive 
character. In his history we meet with trials and temptations not 
to be discovered, as a whole, in other saints of ancient times, and 
hence he is all the more suggestive a type of our Lord. David knew 
the trials of all ranks and conditions of men. Kings have their troubles, 
and David wore a crown: the peasant has his cares, and David handled 
a shepherd’s crook: the wanderer has many hardships, and David abode in the caves 
of Engedi: the captain has his difficulties, and David found the sons 
of Zeruiah too hard for him. The psalmist was also tried in his friends, 
his counsellor Ahithophel forsook him, “He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me.” His worst foes were they of his own household: his children were 
his greatest affliction. The temptations of poverty and wealth, of 
honour and reproach, of health and weakness, all tried their power 
upon him. He had temptations from without to disturb his peace, and 
from within to mar his joy. David no sooner escaped from one trial 
than he fell into another; no sooner emerged from one season of despondency 
and alarm, than he was again brought into the lowest depths, and all 
God’s waves and billows rolled over him. It is probably from this cause 
that David’s psalms are so universally the delight of experienced Christians. 
Whatever our frame of mind, whether ecstasy or depression, David has 
exactly described our emotions. He was an able master of the human 
heart, because he had been tutored in the best of all schools—the school of heart-felt, personal experience. As we are instructed 
in the same school, as we grow matured in grace and in years, we increasingly 
appreciate David’s psalms, and find them to be “green pastures.” My soul, let David’s experience cheer and counsel thee this day.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0820pm-p3">Cities well fortified have broad walls, and so had Jerusalem in her 
glory. The New Jerusalem must, in like manner, be surrounded and preserved 
by a broad wall of nonconformity to the world, and <i>separation</i> from its customs and spirit. The tendency of these days break down 
the holy barrier, and make the distinction between the church and 
the world merely nominal. Professors are no longer strict and Puritanical, 
questionable literature is read on all hands, frivolous pastimes are 
currently indulged, and a general laxity threatens to deprive the 
Lord’s peculiar people of those sacred singularities which separate them 
from sinners. It will be an ill day for the church and the world when 
the proposed amalgamation shall be complete, and the sons of God and 
the daughters of men shall be as one: then shall another deluge of 
wrath be ushered in. Beloved reader, be it your aim in heart, in word, 
in dress, in action to maintain the broad wall, remembering that the 
friendship of this world is enmity against God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0820pm-p4">The broad wall afforded a pleasant place of <i>resort</i> for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, from which they could command prospects 
of the surrounding country. This reminds us of the Lord’s exceeding broad commandments, in which we walk at liberty in communion 
with Jesus, overlooking the scenes of earth, and looking out towards 
the glories of heaven. Separated from the world, and denying ourselves 
all ungodliness and fleshly lusts, we are nevertheless not in prison, 
nor restricted within narrow bounds; nay, we walk at liberty, because 
we keep his precepts. Come, reader, this evening walk with God in 
his statutes. As friend met friend upon the city wall, so meet thou 
thy God in the way of holy prayer and meditation. The bulwarks of 
salvation thou hast a right to traverse, for thou art a freeman of 
the royal burgh, a citizen of the metropolis of the universe.</p>

to accumulate, we must scatter; that to make ourselves happy, we must 
make others happy; and that in order to become spiritually vigorous, 
we must seek the spiritual good of others. In watering others, we 
are ourselves watered. How? Our efforts to be useful, <i>bring out our powers for usefulness</i>. We have latent talents and dormant faculties, which are brought 
to light by exercise. Our strength for labour is hidden even from 
ourselves, until we venture forth to fight the Lord’s battles, or to climb the mountains of difficulty. We do not know 
what tender sympathies we possess until we try to dry the widow’s tears, and soothe the orphan’s grief. We often find in attempting to teach others, that we <i>gain instruction for</i> <i>ourselves</i>. Oh, what gracious lessons some of us have learned at sick beds! 
We went to teach the Scriptures, we came away blushing that we knew 
so little of them. In our converse with poor saints, we are taught 
the way of God more perfectly for ourselves and get a deeper insight 
into divine truth. So that watering others <i>makes us humble</i>. We discover how much grace there is where we had not looked for 
it; and how much the poor saint may outstrip us in knowledge. Our 
own <i>comfort is also</i> <i>increased</i> by our working for others. We endeavour to cheer them, and the consolation 
gladdens our own heart. Like the two men in the snow; one chafed the 
other’s limbs to keep him from dying, and in so doing kept his own blood 
in circulation, and saved his own life. The poor widow of Sarepta 
gave from her scanty store a supply for the prophet’s wants, and from that day she never again knew what want was. Give 
then, and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down,

<p class="normal" id="d0821pm-p3">We may gain much solace by considering what God has <i>not</i> said. What he has said is inexpressibly full of comfort and delight; 
what he has not said is scarcely less rich in consolation. It was 
one of these “<i>said nots</i>” which preserved the kingdom of Israel in the days of Jeroboam the 
son of Joash, for “the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under 
heaven.” <scripRef passage="2Ki 14:27" id="d0821pm-p3.1" parsed="|2Kgs|14|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.14.27">2 Kings 14:27</scripRef>. In our text we have an assurance that God <i>will</i> answer prayer, because he hath “<i>not</i> said unto the seed of Israel, Seek ye me in vain.” You who write bitter things against yourselves should remember that, 
let your doubts and fears say what they will, if <i>God</i> has not cut you off from mercy, there is no room for despair: even 
the voice of conscience is of little weight if it be not seconded 
by the voice of God. What God <i>has</i> said, tremble at! But suffer not your vain imaginings to overwhelm 
you with despondency and sinful despair. Many timid persons have been 
vexed by the suspicion that there may be something in God’s decree which shuts <i>them</i> out from hope, but here is a complete refutation to that troublesome 
fear, for no true seeker can be decreed to wrath. “I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I have 
not said,” even in the secret of my unsearchable decree, “Seek ye me in vain.” God has clearly revealed that he <i>will</i> hear the prayer of those who call upon him, and that declaration 
cannot be contravened. He has so firmly, so truthfully, so righteously 
spoken, that there can be no room for doubt. He does not reveal his 
mind in unintelligible words, but he speaks plainly and positively, 
“Ask, and ye shall receive.” Believe, O trembler, this sure truth—that prayer must and shall be heard, and that never, even in the secrets 
of eternity, has the Lord said unto any living soul, “Seek ye me in vain.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0822am-p3">Such is the language of the believer panting after present fellowship 
with Jesus, <i>he is sick for his Lord</i>. Gracious souls are never perfectly at ease except they are in a 
state of nearness to Christ; for when they are away from him they 
lose their peace. The nearer to him, the nearer to the perfect calm 
of heaven; the nearer to him, the fuller the heart is, not only of 
peace, but of life, and vigour, and joy, for these all depend on constant 
intercourse with Jesus. What the sun is to the day, what the moon 
is to the night, what the dew is to the flower, such is Jesus Christ 
to us. What bread is to the hungry, clothing to the naked, the shadow 
of a great rock to the traveller in a weary land, such is Jesus Christ 
to us; and, therefore, if we are not consciously one with him, little 
marvel if our spirit cries in the words of the Song, “I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, 
tell him that I am sick of love.” <i>This earnest longing after Jesus has a</i> <i>blessing attending it</i>: “Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness”; and therefore, supremely blessed are they who thirst after the Righteous 
One. Blessed is that hunger, since it comes from God: if I may not 
have the full-blown blessedness of being filled, I would seek the 
same blessedness in its sweet bud-pining in emptiness and eagerness till 
I am filled with Christ. If I may not feed on Jesus, it shall be next 
door to heaven to hunger and thirst after him. There is a hallowedness 
about that hunger, since it sparkles among the beatitudes of our Lord. 
But the blessing <i>involves a</i> <i>promise</i>. Such hungry ones “<i>shall be filled</i>” with what they are desiring. If Christ thus causes us to long after 
himself, he will certainly satisfy those longings; and when he does 
come to us, as come he will, <i>oh, how sweet it will be</i>!</p>

than you think him to be when your thoughts are at the greatest. My 
Lord is more ready to pardon than you to sin, more able to forgive 
than you to transgress. My Master is more willing to supply your wants

There is no love like his, neither earth nor heaven can match it. 
To know Christ and to be found in him—oh! this is life, this is joy, this is marrow and fatness, wine on

he gives to them as a king giveth to a king; he gives them two heavens—a heaven below in serving him here, and a heaven above in delighting

<p class="normal" id="d0823am-p3">The glorified weep no more, for <i>all outward causes of</i> <i>grief are gone</i>. There are no broken friendships, nor blighted prospects in heaven. 
Poverty, famine, peril, persecution, and slander, are unknown there. 
No pain distresses, no thought of death or bereavement saddens. They 
weep no more, for <i>they are perfectly sanctified</i>. No “evil heart of unbelief” prompts them to depart from the living God; they are without fault 
before his throne, and are fully conformed to his image. Well may 
they cease to mourn who have ceased to sin. They weep no more, because 
<i>all fear of change is past</i>. They know that they are eternally secure. Sin is shut out, and they 
are shut in. They dwell within a city which shall never be stormed; 
they bask in a sun which shall never set; they drink of a river which 
shall never dry; they pluck fruit from a tree which shall never wither. 
Countless cycles may revolve, but eternity shall not be exhausted, 
and while eternity endures, their immortality and blessedness shall 
co-exist with it. They are forever with the Lord. They weep no more, 
because <i>every desire is</i> <i>fulfilled</i>. They cannot wish for anything which they have not in possession. 
Eye and ear, heart and hand, judgment, imagination, hope, desire, 
will, all the faculties, are completely satisfied; and imperfect as 
our present ideas are of the things which God hath prepared for them 
that love him, yet we know enough, by the revelation of the Spirit, 
that the saints above are supremely blessed. The joy of Christ, which 
is an infinite fulness of delight, is in them. They bathe themselves 
in the bottomless, shoreless sea of infinite beatitude. That same 
joyful rest remains for us. It may not be far distant. Ere long the 
weeping willow shall be exchanged for the palm-branch of victory, 
and sorrow’s dewdrops will be transformed into the pearls of everlasting bliss. 
“Wherefore comfort one another with these words.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0823pm-p3">Beyond measure it is desirable that we, as believers, should have 
the person of Jesus constantly before us, to inflame our love towards 
him, and to increase our knowledge of him. I would to God that my 
readers were all entered as diligent scholars in Jesus’ college, students of Corpus Christi, or the body of Christ, resolved 
to attain unto a good degree in the learning of the cross. But to 
have Jesus ever near, the heart must be full of him, welling up with 
his love, even to overrunning; hence the apostle prays “that Christ may <i>dwell in your hearts</i>.” See how near he would have Jesus to be! You cannot get a subject 
closer to you than to have it in the heart itself. “<i>That he</i> <i>may dwell</i>;” not that he may call upon you sometimes, as a casual visitor enters 
into a house and tarries for a night, but that he may <i>dwell</i>; that Jesus may become the Lord and Tenant of your inmost being, 
never more to go out.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0823pm-p4">Observe the words—that he may dwell <i>in your heart</i>, that best room of the house of manhood; not in your thoughts alone, 
but in your affections; not merely in the mind’s meditations, but in the heart’s emotions. We should pant after love to Christ of a most abiding 
character, not a love that flames up and then dies out into the darkness 
of a few embers, but a constant flame, fed by sacred fuel, like the 
fire upon the altar which never went out. This cannot be accomplished 
except by faith. Faith must be strong, or love will not be fervent; 
the root of the flower must be healthy, or we cannot expect the bloom 
to be sweet. Faith is the lily’s root, and love is the lily’s bloom. Now, reader, Jesus cannot be in your heart’s love except you have a firm hold of him by your heart’s faith; and, therefore, pray that you may always trust Christ in 
order that you may always love him. If love be cold, be sure that 
faith is drooping.</p>

Not only has Christ travelled the road, but he has slain thine enemies. 
Dost thou dread sin? He has nailed it to his cross. Dost thou fear 
death? He has been the death of Death. Art thou afraid of hell? He 
has barred it against the advent of any of his children; they shall 
never see the gulf of perdition. Whatever foes may be before the Christian, 
they are all overcome. There are lions, but their teeth are broken; 
there are serpents, but their fangs are extracted; there are rivers, 
but they are bridged or fordable; there are flames, but we wear that 
matchless garment which renders us invulnerable to fire. The sword 
that has been forged against us is already blunted; the instruments 
of war which the enemy is preparing have already lost their point. 
God has taken away in the person of Christ all the power that anything 
can have to hurt us. Well then, the army may safely march on, and 
you may go joyously along your journey, for all your enemies are conquered 
beforehand. What shall you do but march on to take the prey? They 
are beaten, they are vanquished; all you have to do is to divide the 
spoil. You shall, it is true, often engage in combat; but your fight 
shall be with a vanquished foe. His head is broken; he may attempt 
to injure you, but his strength shall not be sufficient for his malicious 
design. Your victory shall be easy, and your treasure shall be beyond

and the result is irretrievable. If such an offender be forgiven, 
what grief it will cause him in the retrospect, since he cannot undo 
the mischief which he has done! An ill example may kindle a flame 
which years of amended character cannot quench. To burn the food of 
man is bad enough, but how much worse to destroy the soul! It may 
be useful to us to reflect how far we may have been guilty in the

to reward the toil of the great Boaz, the fire of enmity comes in 
and leaves little else but smoke and a heap of blackness. Woe unto 
those by whom offences come. May they never come through us, for although 
we cannot make restitution, we shall certainly be the chief sufferers 
if we are the chief offenders. Those who feed the fire deserve just 
censure, but he who first kindles it is most to blame. Discord usually 
takes first hold upon the thorns; it is nurtured among the hypocrites 
and base professors in the church, and away it goes among the righteous, 
blown by the winds of hell, and no one knows where it may end. O thou 
Lord and giver of peace, make us peacemakers, and never let us aid

<p class="normal" id="d0825am-p3">Faith, in the Scripture, is spoken of under the emblem of all the 
senses. It is <i>sight</i>: “Look unto me and be ye saved.” It is <i>hearing</i>: “Hear, and your soul shall live.” Faith is <i>smelling</i>: “All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia”; “thy name is as ointment poured forth.” Faith is spiritual <i>touch</i>. By this faith the woman came behind and touched the hem of Christ’s garment, and by this we handle the things of the good word of life. 
Faith is equally the spirit’s taste. “How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my 
lips.” “Except a man eat my flesh,” saith Christ, <i>“and drink my blood, there is no life in him.”</i></p>
<p class="normal" id="d0825am-p4">This “<i>taste</i>” is faith <i>in one of its highest</i> <i>operations</i>. One of the first performances of faith is <i>hearing</i>. We hear the voice of God, not with the outward ear alone, but with 
the inward ear; we hear it as God’s Word, and we believe it to be so; that is the “hearing” of faith. Then our mind <i>looketh</i> upon the truth as it is presented to us; that is to say, we understand 
it, we perceive its meaning; that is the “seeing” of faith. Next we discover its preciousness; we begin to admire it, 
and find how fragrant it is; that is faith in its “<i>smell</i>.” Then we appropriate the mercies which are prepared for us in Christ; 
that is faith in its “<i>touch</i>.” Hence follow the enjoyments, peace, delight, communion; which are 
faith in its “taste.” Any one of these acts of faith is saving. To hear Christ’s voice as the sure voice of God in the soul will save us; but that 
which gives true enjoyment is the aspect of faith wherein Christ, 
by holy taste, is received into us, and made, by inward and spiritual 
apprehension of his sweetness and preciousness, to be the food of 
our souls. It is then we sit “under his shadow with great delight,” and find his fruit sweet to our taste.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0825pm-p3">These words may answer your scruples, devout reader, concerning <i>the ordinances</i>. Perhaps you say, “I should be afraid to be baptized; it is such a solemn thing to avow 
myself to be dead with Christ, and buried with him. I should not feel 
at liberty to come to the Master’s table; I should be afraid of eating and drinking damnation unto 
myself, not discerning the Lord’s body.” Ah! poor trembler, Jesus has given you liberty, be not afraid. If 
a stranger came to your house, he would stand at the door, or wait 
in the hall; he would not dream of intruding unbidden into your parlour—he is not at home: but your child makes himself very free about the 
house; and so is it with the child of God. A stranger may not intrude 
where a child may venture. When the Holy Ghost has given you to feel 
the spirit of adoption, you may come to Christian ordinances without 
fear. The same rule holds good of the <i>Christian’s inward privileges</i>. You think, poor seeker, that you are not allowed to rejoice with 
joy unspeakable and full of glory; if you are permitted to get inside 
Christ’s door, or sit at the bottom of his table, you will be well content. 
Ah! but you shall not have less privileges than the very greatest. 
God makes no difference in his love to his children. A child is a 
child to him; he will not make him a hired servant; but he shall feast 
upon the fatted calf, and shall have the music and the dancing as 
much as if he had never gone astray. When Jesus comes into the heart, 
he issues a general licence to be glad in the Lord. No chains are 
worn in the court of King Jesus. Our admission into full privileges 
may be gradual, but it is sure. Perhaps our reader is saying, “I wish I could enjoy the promises, and walk at liberty in my Lord’s commands.” “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.” Loose the chains of thy neck, O captive daughter, for Jesus makes 
thee free.</p>

of consolation to them so often as the Holy Spirit leads them into 
its banqueting house and waves its banner of love. They delight to 
contemplate <i>the antiquity</i> of that covenant, remembering that before the day-star knew its place, 
or planets ran their round, the interests of the saints were made 
secure in Christ Jesus. It is peculiarly pleasing to them to remember 
<i>the sureness</i> of the covenant, while meditating upon “the sure mercies of David.” They delight to celebrate it as “signed, and sealed, and ratified, in all things ordered well.” It often makes their hearts dilate with joy to think of its <i>immutability</i>, as a covenant which neither time nor eternity, life nor death, shall 
ever be able to violate—a covenant as old as eternity and as everlasting as the Rock of ages. 
They rejoice also to feast upon <i>the fulness</i> of this covenant, for they see in it all things provided for them. 
God is their portion, Christ their companion, the Spirit their Comforter, 
earth their lodge, and heaven their home. They see in it an inheritance 
reserved and entailed to every soul possessing an interest in its 
ancient and eternal deed of gift. Their eyes sparkled when they saw 
it as a treasure-trove in the Bible; but oh! how their souls were 
gladdened when they saw in the last will and testament of their divine 
kinsman, that it was bequeathed to them! More especially it is the 
pleasure of God’s people to contemplate <i>the graciousness</i> of this covenant. They see that the law was made void because it 
was a covenant of works and depended upon merit, but this they perceive 
to be enduring because grace is the basis, grace the condition, grace 
the strain, grace the bulwark, grace the foundation, grace the topstone. 
The covenant is a treasury of wealth, a granary of food, a fountain 
of life, a store-house of salvation, a charter of peace, and a haven 
of joy.</p>

of Horeb had been forty days upon the mountain, he underwent a kind 
of transfiguration, so that his countenance shone with exceeding brightness, 
and he put a veil over his face, for the people could not endure to 
look upon his glory. Not so our Saviour. He had been transfigured 
with a greater glory than that of Moses, and yet, it is not written 
that the people were blinded by the blaze of his countenance, but 
rather they were amazed, and running to him they saluted him. The 
glory of the law repels, but the greater glory of Jesus attracts. 
Though Jesus is holy and just, yet blended with his purity there is 
so much of truth and grace, that sinners run to him amazed at his 
goodness, fascinated by his love; they salute him, become his disciples, 
and take him to be their Lord and Master. Reader, it may be that just 
now you are blinded by the dazzling brightness of the law of God. 
You feel its claims on your conscience, but you cannot keep it in 
your life. Not that you find fault with the law, on the contrary, 
it commands your profoundest esteem, still you are in nowise drawn 
by it to God; you are rather hardened in heart, and are verging towards 
desperation. Ah, poor heart! turn thine eye from Moses, with all his 
repelling splendour, and look to Jesus, resplendent with milder glories. 
Behold his flowing wounds and thorn-crowned head! He is the Son of 
God, and therein he is greater than Moses, but he is the Lord of love, 
and therein more tender than the lawgiver. He bore the wrath of God, 
and in his death revealed more of God’s justice than Sinai on a blaze, but that justice is now vindicated, 
and henceforth it is the guardian of believers in Jesus. Look, sinner, 
to the bleeding Saviour, and as thou feelest the attraction of his 
love, fly to his arms, and thou shalt be saved.</p>

if we insult him by indulging it. It is true it is a weed, the seeds 
of which we can never entirely extract from the soil, but we must 
aim at its root with zeal and perseverance. Among hateful things it 
is the most to be abhorred. Its injurious nature is so venomous that 
he that exerciseth it and he upon whom it is exercised are both hurt

thou dost distrust the Lord Jesus, he may well cry out, “Behold I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of 
sheaves.” This is crowning his head with thorns of the sharpest kind. It is 
very cruel for a well-beloved wife to mistrust a kind and faithful 
husband. The sin is needless, foolish, and unwarranted. Jesus has 
never given the slightest ground for suspicion, and it is hard to 
be doubted by those to whom our conduct is uniformly affectionate

it is shameful to doubt Omnipotence and distrust all-sufficiency. 
The cattle on a thousand hills will suffice for our most hungry feeding, 
and the granaries of heaven are not likely to be emptied by our eating. 
If Christ were only a cistern, we might soon exhaust his fulness,

an absent Saviour. Bunyan tells us that unbelief has “as many lives as a cat:” if so, let us kill one life now, and continue the work till the whole 
nine are gone. Down with thee, thou traitor, my heart abhors thee.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0827pm-p3">These words have been frequently used by holy men in their hour of 
departure. We may profitably consider them this evening. The object 
of the faithful man’s solicitude in life and death is not his body or his estate, but 
his spirit; this is his choice treasure—if this be safe, all is well. What is this mortal state compared with 
the soul? The believer commits his soul to the hand of his God; it 
came from him, it is his own, he has aforetime sustained it, he is 
able to keep it, and it is most fit that he should receive it. All 
things are safe in Jehovah’s hands; what we entrust to the Lord will be secure, both now and 
in that day of days towards which we are hastening. It is peaceful 
living, and glorious dying, to repose in the care of heaven. At all 
times we should commit our all to Jesus’ faithful hand; then, though life may hang on a thread, and adversities 
may multiply as the sands of the sea, our soul shall dwell at ease, 
and delight itself in quiet resting places.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0827pm-p4">“<i>Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth</i>.” Redemption is a solid basis for confidence. David had not known Calvary 
as we have done, but temporal redemption cheered him; and shall not 
eternal redemption yet more sweetly console us? Past deliverances 
are strong pleas for present assistance. What the Lord has done he 
will do again, for he changes not. He is faithful to his promises, 
and gracious to his saints; he will not turn away from his people.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0828am-p3">My soul, how much thou needest this, for thy lamp will not long continue 
to burn without it. Thy snuff will smoke and become an offence if 
light be gone, and gone it will be if oil be absent. Thou hast no 
oil well springing up in thy human nature, and therefore thou must 
go to them that sell and buy for thyself, or like the foolish virgins, 
thou wilt have to cry, “My lamp is gone out.” Even the consecrated lamps could not give light without oil; though 
they shone in the tabernacle they needed to be fed, though no rough 
winds blew upon them they required to be trimmed, and thy need is 
equally as great. Under the most happy circumstances thou canst not 
give light for another hour unless fresh oil of grace be given thee.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0828am-p4">It was not every oil that might be used in the Lord’s service; neither the petroleum which exudes so plentifully from 
the earth, nor the produce of fishes, nor that extracted from nuts 
would be accepted; one oil only was selected, and that the best olive 
oil. Pretended grace from natural goodness, fancied grace from priestly 
hands, or imaginary grace from outward ceremonies will never serve 
the true saint of God; he knows that the Lord would not be pleased 
with rivers of such oil. He goes to the olive-press of Gethsemane, 
and draws his supplies from him who was crushed therein. The oil of 
gospel grace is pure and free from lees and dregs, and hence the light 
which is fed thereon is clear and bright. Our churches are the Saviour’s golden candelabra, and if they are to be lights in this dark world, they 
must have much holy oil. Let us pray for ourselves, our ministers, 
and our churches, that they may never lack oil for the light. Truth, 
holiness, joy, knowledge, love, these are all beams of the sacred 
light, but we cannot give them forth unless in private we receive 
oil from God the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0828pm-p3">Though we have brought forth some fruit unto Christ, and have a joyful 
hope that we are “plants of his own right hand planting,” yet there are times when we feel very barren. Prayer is lifeless, 
love is cold, faith is weak, each grace in the garden of our heart 
languishes and droops. We are like flowers in the hot sun, requiring 
the refreshing shower. In such a condition what are we to do? The 
text is addressed to us in just such a state. “<i>Sing, O barren, break forth and cry aloud</i>.” But what can I sing about? I cannot talk about the present, and even 
the past looks full of barrenness. Ah! I can sing of Jesus Christ. 
I can talk of visits which the Redeemer has aforetimes paid to me; 
or if not of these, I can magnify the great love wherewith he loved 
his people when he came from the heights of heaven for their redemption. 
I will go to the cross again. Come, my soul, heavy laden thou wast 
once, and thou didst lose thy burden there. Go to Calvary again. Perhaps 
that very cross which gave thee life may give thee fruitfulness. What 
is my barrenness? It is the platform for his fruit-creating power. 
What is my desolation? It is the black setting for the sapphire of 
his everlasting love. I will go in poverty, I will go in helplessness, 
I will go in all my shame and backsliding, I will tell him that I 
am still his child, and in confidence in his faithful heart, even 
I, the barren one, will sing and cry aloud.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0828pm-p4">Sing, believer, for it will cheer thine own heart, and the hearts 
of other desolate ones. Sing on, for now that thou art really ashamed 
of being barren, thou wilt be fruitful soon; now that God makes thee 
<i>loath</i> to be without fruit he will soon cover thee with clusters. The experience 
of our barrenness is painful, but the Lord’s visitations are delightful. A sense of our own poverty drives us 
to Christ, and that is where we need to be, for in him is our fruit 
found.</p>

was made, “If this sickness should prove fatal, what passage would you select 
as the text for your funeral sermon?” He replied, “Oh, I feel that such a poor sinful creature is unworthy to have anything 
said about him; but if a funeral sermon must be preached, let it be 
from the words, ‘Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness; according 
unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.’” In the same spirit of humility he directed in his will that the following

above all others that they are men at the best. Empty boats float 
high, but heavily laden vessels are low in the water; mere professors 
can boast, but true children of God cry for mercy upon their unprofitableness. 
We have need that the Lord should have mercy upon our good works, 
our prayers, our preachings, our alms-givings, and our holiest things. 
The blood was not only sprinkled upon the doorposts of Israel’s dwelling houses, but upon the sanctuary, the mercy-seat, and the 
altar, because as sin intrudes into our holiest things, the blood 
of Jesus is needed to purify them from defilement. If mercy be needed 
to be exercised towards our duties, what shall be said of our sins? 
How sweet the remembrance that inexhaustible mercy is waiting to be 
gracious to us, to restore our backslidings, and make our broken bones 
rejoice!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0829pm-p3">Nazarites had taken, among other vows, one which debarred them from 
the use of wine. In order that they might not violate the obligation, 
they were forbidden to drink the vinegar of wine or strong liquors, 
and to make the rule still more clear, they were not to touch the 
unfermented juice of grapes, nor even to eat the fruit either fresh 
or dried. In order, altogether, to secure the integrity of the vow, 
they were not even allowed anything that had to do with the vine; 
they were, in fact, to avoid the appearance of evil. Surely this is 
a lesson to the Lord’s separated ones, teaching them to come away from sin in every form, 
to avoid not merely its grosser shapes, but even its spirit and similitude. 
Strict walking is much despised in these days, but rest assured, dear 
reader, it is both the safest and the happiest. He who yields a point 
or two to the world is in fearful peril; he who eats the grapes of 
Sodom will soon drink the wine of Gomorrah. A little crevice in the 
sea-bank in Holland lets in the sea, and the gap speedily swells till 
a province is drowned. Worldly conformity, in any degree, is a snare 
to the soul, and makes it more and more liable to presumptuous sins. 
Moreover, as the Nazarite who drank grape juice could not be quite 
sure whether it might not have endured a degree of fermentation, and 
consequently could not be clear in heart that his vow was intact, 
so the yielding, temporizing Christian cannot wear a conscience void 
of offence, but must feel that the inward monitor is in doubt of him. 
Things doubtful we need not doubt about; they are wrong to us. Things 
tempting we must not dally with, but flee from them with speed. Better 
be sneered at as a Puritan than be despised as a hypocrite. Careful 
walking may involve much self-denial, but it has pleasures of its 
own which are more than a sufficient recompense.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0830am-p3">It may seem an easy thing to wait, but it is one of the postures which 
a Christian soldier learns not without years of teaching. Marching 
and quick-marching are much easier to God’s warriors than standing still. There are hours of perplexity when 
the most willing spirit, anxiously desirous to serve the Lord, knows 
not what part to take. Then what shall it do? Vex itself by despair? 
Fly back in cowardice, turn to the right hand in fear, or rush forward 
in presumption? No, but simply wait. <i>Wait in prayer</i>, however. Call upon God, and spread the case before him; tell him 
your difficulty, and plead his promise of aid. In dilemmas between 
one duty and another, it is sweet to be humble as a child, and <i>wait with simplicity of soul</i> upon the Lord. It is sure to be well with us when we feel and know 
our own folly, and are heartily willing to be guided by the will of 
God. But <i>wait in faith</i>. Express your unstaggering confidence in him; for unfaithful, untrusting 
waiting, is but an insult to the Lord. Believe that if he keep you 
tarrying even till midnight, yet he will come at the right time; the 
vision shall come and shall not tarry. <i>Wait in quiet patience</i>, not rebelling because you are under the affliction, but blessing 
your God for it. Never murmur against the second cause, as the children 
of Israel did against Moses; never wish you could go back to the world 
again, but accept the case as it is, and put it as it stands, simply 
and with your whole heart, without any self-will, into the hand of 
your covenant God, saying, “Now, Lord, not my will, but thine be done. I know not what to do; 
I am brought to extremities, but I will wait until thou shalt cleave 
the floods, or drive back my foes. I will wait, if thou keep me many 
a day, for my heart is fixed upon thee alone, O God, and my spirit 
waiteth for thee in the full conviction that thou wilt yet be my joy 
and my salvation, my refuge and my strong tower.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0830pm-p3">It is the sole prerogative of God to remove spiritual disease. Natural 
disease may be instrumentally healed by men, but even then the honour 
is to be given to God who giveth virtue unto medicine, and bestoweth 
power unto the human frame to cast off disease. As for spiritual sicknesses, 
these remain with the great Physician alone; he claims it as his prerogative, 
“I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal;” and one of the Lord’s choice titles is Jehovah-Rophi, the Lord that healeth thee. “I will heal thee of thy wounds,” is a promise which could not come from the lip of man, but only from 
the mouth of the eternal God. On this account the psalmist cried unto 
the Lord, “O Lord, heal me, for my bones are sore vexed,” and again, “Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.” For this, also, the godly praise the name of the Lord, saying, “He healeth all our diseases.” He who made man can restore man; he who was at first the creator 
of our nature can new create it. What a transcendent comfort it is 
that in the person of Jesus “dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily!” My soul, whatever thy disease may be, this great Physician can heal 
thee. If he be God, there can be no limit to his power. Come then 
with the blind eye of darkened understanding, come with the limping 
foot of wasted energy, come with the maimed hand of weak faith, the 
fever of an angry temper, or the ague of shivering despondency, come 
just as thou art, for he who is God can certainly restore thee of 
thy plague. None shall restrain the healing virtue which proceeds 
from Jesus our Lord. Legions of devils have been made to own the power 
of the beloved Physician, and never once has he been baffled. All 
his patients have been cured in the past and shall be in the future, 
and thou shalt be one among them, my friend, if thou wilt but rest 
thyself in him this night.</p>

he can trust to, and is therefore compelled to cast himself on his 
God alone. When his vessel is on its beam-ends, and no human deliverance 
can avail, he must simply and entirely trust himself to the providence 
and care of God. Happy storm that wrecks a man on such a rock as this! 
O blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God alone! There 
is no getting at our God sometimes because of the multitude of our 
friends; but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless that 
he has nowhere else to turn, he flies into his Father’s arms, and is blessedly clasped therein! When he is burdened with 
troubles so pressing and so peculiar, that he cannot tell them to 
any but his God, he may be thankful for them; for he will learn more 
of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh, tempest-tossed believer, 
it is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father! Now that thou 
hast only thy God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full confidence 
in him. Dishonour not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and fears; 
but be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Show the world that thy 
God is worth ten thousand worlds to thee. Show rich men how rich thou 
art in thy poverty when the Lord God is thy helper. Show the strong 
man how strong thou art in thy weakness when underneath thee are the 
everlasting arms. Now is the time for feats of faith and valiant exploits. 
Be strong and very courageous, and the Lord thy God shall certainly, 
as surely as he built the heavens and the earth, glorify himself in 
thy weakness, and magnify his might in the midst of thy distress. 
The grandeur of the arch of heaven would be spoiled if the sky were 
supported by a single visible column, and your faith would lose its 
glory if it rested on anything discernible by the carnal eye. May 
the Holy Spirit give you to rest in Jesus this closing day of the

able to walk as clearly in the light as he is whom we call “Our Father,” of whom it is written, “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all?” Certainly, this is the model which is set before us, for the Saviour 
himself said, “Be ye perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect;” and although we may feel that we can never rival the perfection of 
God, yet we are to seek after it, and never to be satisfied until 
we attain to it. The youthful artist, as he grasps his early pencil, 
can hardly hope to equal Raphael or Michael Angelo, but still, if 
he did not have a noble <i>beau ideal</i> before his mind, he would only attain to something very mean and 
ordinary. But what is meant by the expression that the Christian is 
to walk in light as God is in the light? We conceive it to import 
<i>likeness</i>, but not <i>degree</i>. We are as truly in the light, we are as heartily in the light, we 
are as sincerely in the light, as honestly in the light, though we 
cannot be there in the same measure. I cannot dwell in the sun, it 
is too bright a place for my residence, but I can <i>walk</i> in the light of the sun; and so, though I cannot attain to that perfection 
of purity and truth which belongs to the Lord of hosts by nature as 
the infinitely good, yet I can set the Lord always before me, and 
strive, by the help of the indwelling Spirit, after conformity to 
his image. That famous old commentator, John Trapp, says, “We may be in the light as God is in the light for <i>quality</i>, but not for <i>equality</i>.” We are to have the same light, and are as truly to have it and walk 
in it as God does, though, as for equality with God in his holiness 
and purity, that must be left until we cross the Jordan and enter 
into the perfection of the Most High. Mark that the blessings of sacred 
fellowship and perfect cleansing are bound up with walking in the 
light.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0901am-p3">The Psalmist felt his need of divine guidance. He had just been discovering 
the foolishness of his own heart, and lest he should be constantly 
led astray by it, he resolved that God’s counsel should henceforth guide him. A sense of our own folly is 
a great step towards being wise, when it leads us to rely on the wisdom 
of the Lord. The blind man leans on his friend’s arm and reaches home in safety, and so would we give ourselves up 
implicitly to divine guidance, nothing doubting; assured that though 
we cannot see, it is always safe to trust the all-seeing God. “<i>Thou shalt</i>,” is a blessed expression of confidence. He was sure that the Lord 
would not decline the condescending task. There is a word for thee, 
O believer; rest thou in it. Be assured that thy God will be thy counsellor 
and friend; he shall guide thee; he will direct all thy ways. In his 
written Word thou hast this assurance in part fulfilled, for holy 
Scripture is his counsel to thee. Happy are we to have God’s Word always to guide us! What were the mariner without his compass? 
And what were the Christian without the Bible? This is the unerring 
chart, the map in which every shoal is described, and all the channels 
from the quicksands of destruction to the haven of salvation mapped 
and marked by one who knows all the way. Blessed be thou, O God, that 
we may trust thee to guide us now, and guide us even to the end! After 
this guidance through life, the Psalmist anticipates a divine reception 
at last—“<i>and</i> <i>afterward receive me to glory</i>.” What a thought for thee, believer! God himself will receive <i>thee</i> to glory—<i>thee</i>! Wandering, erring, straying, yet he will bring thee safe at last 
to glory! This is thy portion; live on it this day, and if perplexities 
should surround thee, go in the strength of this text straight to 
the throne.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0901pm-p3">Faith is as much the rule of temporal as of spiritual life; we ought 
to have faith in God for our earthly affairs as well as for our heavenly 
business. It is only as we learn to trust in God for the supply of 
all our daily need that we shall live above the world. We are not 
to be idle, <i>that</i> would show we did <i>not</i> trust in God, who worketh hitherto, but in the devil, who is the 
father of idleness. We are not to be imprudent or rash; that were 
to trust chance, and not the living God, who is a God of economy and 
order. Acting in all prudence and uprightness, we are to rely simply 
and entirely upon the Lord at all times.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0901pm-p4">Let me commend to you a life of trust in God in temporal things. Trusting 
in God, you will not be compelled to mourn because you have used sinful 
means to grow rich. Serve God with integrity, and if you achieve no 
success, at least no sin will lie upon your conscience. Trusting God, 
you will not be guilty of self-contradiction. He who trusts in craft, 
sails this way today, and that way the next, like a vessel tossed 
about by the fickle wind; but he that trusteth in the Lord is like 
a vessel propelled by steam, she cuts through the waves, defies the 
wind, and makes one bright silvery straightforward track to her destined 
haven. Be you a man with living principles within; never bow to the 
varying customs of worldly wisdom. Walk in your path of integrity 
with steadfast steps, and show that you are invincibly strong in the 
strength which confidence in God alone can confer. Thus you will be 
delivered from anxious care, you will not be troubled with evil tidings, 
your heart will be fixed, trusting in the Lord. How pleasant to float 
along the stream of providence! There is no more blessed way of living 
than a life of dependence upon a covenant-keeping God. We have no 
care, for he careth for us; we have no troubles, because we cast our 
burdens upon the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0902am-p3">Very interesting is this little peep into the house of the Apostolic 
Fisherman. We see at once that household joys and cares are no hindrance 
to the full exercise of ministry, nay, that since they furnish an 
opportunity for personally witnessing the Lord’s gracious work upon one’s own flesh and blood, they may even instruct the teacher better than 
any other earthly discipline. Papists and other sectaries may decry 
marriage, but true Christianity and household life agree well together. 
Peter’s house was probably a poor fisherman’s hut, but the Lord of Glory entered it, lodged in it, and wrought 
a miracle in it. Should our little book be read this morning in some 
very humble cottage, let this fact encourage the inmates to seek the 
company of King Jesus. God is oftener in little huts than in rich 
palaces. Jesus is looking round your room now, and is waiting to be 
gracious to you. Into Simon’s house sickness had entered, fever in a deadly form had prostrated 
his mother-in-law, and as soon as Jesus came they told him of the 
sad affliction, and he hastened to the patient’s bed. Have you any sickness in the house this morning? You will find 
Jesus by far the best physician, go to him at once and tell him all 
about the matter. Immediately lay the case before him. It concerns 
one of his people, and therefore will not be trivial to him. Observe, 
that at once the Saviour restored the sick woman; none can heal as 
he does. We may not make sure that the Lord will at once remove all 
disease from those we love, but we may know that believing prayer 
for the sick is far more likely to be followed by restoration than 
anything else in the world; and where this avails not, we must meekly 
bow to his will by whom life and death are determined. The tender 
heart of Jesus waits to hear our griefs, let us pour them into his 
patient ear.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0902pm-p3">A craving after marvels was a symptom of the sickly state of men’s minds in our Lord’s day; they refused solid nourishment, and pined after mere wonder. 
The gospel which they so greatly needed they would not have; the miracles 
which Jesus did not always choose to give they eagerly demanded. Many 
nowadays must see signs and wonders, or they will not believe. Some 
have said in their heart, “I must feel deep horror of soul, or I never will believe in Jesus.” But what if you never should feel it, as probably you never may? 
Will you go to hell out of spite against God, because he will not 
treat you like another? One has said to himself, “If I had a dream, or if I could feel a sudden shock of I know not 
what, then I would believe.” Thus you undeserving mortals dream that my Lord is to be dictated 
to by you! You are beggars at his gate, asking for mercy, and you 
must needs draw up rules and regulations as to how he shall give that 
mercy. Think you that he will submit to this? My Master is of a generous 
spirit, but he has a right royal heart, he spurns all dictation, and 
maintains his sovereignty of action. Why, dear reader, if such be 
your case, do you crave for signs and wonders? Is not the gospel its 
own sign and wonder? Is not this a miracle of miracles, that “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
believeth in him might not perish”? Surely that precious word, “Whosoever will, let him come and take the water of life freely” and that solemn promise, “Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out,” are better than signs and wonders! A truthful Saviour ought to be 
believed. He is truth itself. Why will you ask proof of the veracity 
of One who cannot lie? The devils themselves declared him to be the 
Son of God; will you mistrust him?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0903am-p3">It is well to be able, without any “if” or “but,” to say of the Lord Jesus—“<i>Thou whom my soul loveth</i>.” Many can only say of Jesus that they <i>hope</i> they love him; they <i>trust</i> they love him; but only a poor and shallow experience will be content 
to stay here. No one ought to give any rest to his spirit till he 
feels quite sure about a matter of such vital importance. We ought not to be satisfied 
with a superficial <i>hope</i> that Jesus loves us, and with a bare trust that we love him. The 
old saints did not generally speak with “buts,” and “ifs,” and “hopes,” and “trusts,” but they spoke positively and plainly. “I know whom I have believed,” saith Paul. “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” saith Job. Get positive knowledge of your love of Jesus, and be not 
satisfied till you can speak of your interest in him as a reality, 
which you have made sure by having received the witness of the Holy 
Spirit, and his seal upon your soul by faith.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0903am-p4">True love to Christ is in every case the Holy Spirit’s work, and must be wrought in the heart by him. He is the <i>efficient</i> <i>cause</i> of it; but the logical reason why we love Jesus lies in <i>himself. Why</i> do we love Jesus? <i>Because he first loved</i> <i>us. Why</i> do we love Jesus? Because he “<i>gave himself for</i> <i>us</i>.” We have life through his death; we have peace through his blood. 
Though he was rich, yet <i>for our sakes</i> he became poor. Why do we love Jesus? Because of the <i>excellency of his</i> <i>person</i>. We are filled with a sense of his beauty! an admiration of his charms! 
a consciousness of his infinite perfection! His greatness, goodness, 
and loveliness, in one resplendent ray, combine to enchant the soul 
till it is so ravished that it exclaims, “Yea, he is altogether lovely.” Blessed love this—a love which binds the heart with chains more soft than silk, and 
yet more firm than adamant!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0903pm-p3">All events are under the control of Providence; consequently all the 
trials of our outward life are traceable at once to the great First 
Cause. Out of the golden gate of God’s ordinance the armies of trial march forth in array, clad in their 
iron armour, and armed with weapons of war. All providences are doors 
to trial. Even our mercies, like roses, have their thorns. Men may 
be drowned in seas of prosperity as well as in rivers of affliction. 
Our mountains are not too high, and our valleys are not too low for 
temptations: trials lurk on all roads. Everywhere, above and beneath, 
we are beset and surrounded with dangers. Yet no shower falls unpermitted 
from the threatening cloud; every drop has its order ere it hastens 
to the earth. The trials which come from God are sent to prove and 
strengthen our graces, and so at once to illustrate the power of divine 
grace, to test the genuineness of our virtues, and to add to their 
energy. Our Lord in his infinite wisdom and superabundant love, sets 
so high a value upon his people’s faith that he will not screen them from those trials by which faith 
is strengthened. You would never have possessed the precious faith 
which now supports you if the trial of your faith had not been like 
unto fire. You are a tree that never would have rooted so well if 
the wind had not rocked you to and fro, and made you take firm hold 
upon the precious truths of the covenant grace. Worldly ease is a 
great foe to faith; it loosens the joints of holy valour, and snaps 
the sinews of sacred courage. The balloon never rises until the cords 
are cut; affliction doth this sharp service for believing souls. While 
the wheat sleeps comfortably in the husk it is useless to man, it 
must be threshed out of its resting place before its value can be 
known. Thus it is well that Jehovah trieth the righteous, for it causeth 
them to grow rich towards God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0904am-p3">Primeval darkness heard the Almighty fiat, “light be,” and straightway light was, and the word of the Lord Jesus is equal 
in majesty to that ancient word of power. Redemption like Creation 
has its word of might. Jesus speaks and it is done. Leprosy yielded 
to no human remedies, but it fled at once at the Lord’s “I will.” The disease exhibited no hopeful signs or tokens of recovery, nature 
contributed nothing to its own healing, but the unaided word effected 
the entire work on the spot and forever. The sinner is in a plight 
more miserable than the leper; let him imitate his example and go 
to Jesus, “beseeching him and kneeling down to him.” Let him exercise what little faith he has, even though it should 
go no further than “Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean;” and there need be no doubt as to the result of the application. Jesus 
heals all who come, and casts out none. In reading the narrative in 
which our morning’s text occurs, it is worthy of devout notice that Jesus touched the 
leper. This unclean person had broken through the regulations of the 
ceremonial law and pressed into the house, but Jesus so far from chiding 
him broke through the law himself in order to meet him. He made an 
interchange with the leper, for while he cleansed him, he contracted 
by that touch a Levitical defilement. Even so Jesus Christ was made 
sin for us, although in himself he knew no sin, that we might be made 
the righteousness of God in him. O that poor sinners would go to Jesus, 
believing in the power of his blessed substitutionary work, and they 
would soon learn the power of his gracious touch. That hand which 
multiplied the loaves, which saved sinking Peter, which upholds afflicted 
saints, which crowns believers, that same hand will touch every seeking 
sinner, and in a moment make him clean. The love of Jesus is the source 
of salvation. He loves, he looks, he touches us, <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d0904am-p3.1">we live</span>.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0904pm-p3">Weights, and scales, and measures were to be all according to the 
standard of justice. Surely no Christian man will need to be reminded 
of this in his business, for if righteousness were banished from all 
the world beside, it should find a shelter in believing hearts. There 
are, however, other balances which weigh moral and spiritual things, 
and these often need examining. We will call in the officer tonight.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0904pm-p4">The balances in which we weigh our own and other men’s characters, are they quite accurate? Do we not turn our own ounces 
of goodness into pounds, and other persons’ bushels of excellence into pecks? See to weights and measures here, 
Christian. The scales in which we measure our trials and troubles, 
are they according to standard? Paul, who had more to suffer than 
we have, called his afflictions light, and yet we often consider ours 
to be heavy—surely something must be amiss with the weights! We must see to this 
matter, lest we get reported to the court above for unjust dealing. 
Those weights with which we measure our doctrinal belief, are they 
quite fair? The doctrines of grace should have the same weight with 
us as the precepts of the word, no more and no less; but it is to 
be feared that with many one scale or the other is unfairly weighted. 
It is a grand matter to give just measure in truth. Christian, be 
careful here. Those measures in which we estimate our obligations 
and responsibilities look rather small. When a rich man gives no more 
to the cause of God than the poor contribute, is that a just ephah 
and a just hin? When ministers are half starved, is that honest dealing? 
When the poor are despised, while ungodly rich men are held in admiration, 
is that a just balance? Reader, we might lengthen the list, but we 
prefer to leave it as your evening’s work to find out and destroy all unrighteous balances, weights, 
and measures.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0905am-p3">As a Christian you have to live in the midst of an ungodly world, 
and it is of little use for you to cry “Woe is me.” Jesus did not pray that you should be taken out of the world, and 
what he did not pray for, you need not desire. Better far in the Lord’s strength to meet the difficulty, and glorify him in it. The enemy 
is ever on the watch to detect inconsistency in your conduct; be therefore 
very <i>holy</i>. Remember that the eyes of all are upon you, and that more is expected 
from you than from other men. Strive to give no occasion for blame. 
Let your goodness be the only fault they can discover in you. Like 
Daniel, compel them to say of you, “We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find 
it against him concerning the law of his God.” Seek to be <i>useful</i> as well as consistent. Perhaps you think, “If I were in a more favourable position I might serve the Lord’s cause, but I cannot do any good where I am”; but the worse the people are among whom you live, the more need 
have they of your exertions; if they be crooked, the more necessity 
that you should set them straight; and if they be perverse, the more 
need have you to turn their proud hearts to the truth. Where should 
the physician be but where there are many sick? Where is honour to 
be won by the soldier but in the hottest fire of the battle? And when 
weary of the strife and sin that meets you on every hand, consider 
that all the saints have endured the same trial. They were not carried 
on beds of down to heaven, and you must not expect to travel more 
easily than they. They had to hazard their lives unto the death in 
the high places of the field, and you will not be crowned till you 
also have endured hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Therefore, 
“stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0905pm-p3">Some things in nature must remain a mystery to the most intelligent 
and enterprising investigators. Human knowledge has bounds beyond 
which it cannot pass. Universal knowledge is for God alone. If this 
be so in the things which are seen and temporal, I may rest assured 
that it is even more so in matters spiritual and eternal. Why, then, 
have I been torturing my brain with speculations as to destiny and 
will, fixed fate, and human responsibility? These deep and dark truths 
I am no more able to comprehend than to find out the depth which coucheth 
beneath, from which old ocean draws her watery stores. Why am I so 
curious to know the reason of my Lord’s providences, the motive of his actions, the design of his visitations? 
Shall I ever be able to clasp the sun in my fist, and hold the universe 
in my palm? yet these are as a drop of a bucket compared with the 
Lord my God. Let me not strive to understand the infinite, but spend 
my strength in love. What I cannot gain by intellect I can possess 
by affection, and let that suffice me. I cannot penetrate the heart 
of the sea, but I can enjoy the healthful breezes which sweep over 
its bosom, and I can sail over its blue waves with propitious winds. 
If I could enter the springs of the sea, the feat would serve no useful 
purpose either to myself or to others, it would not save the sinking 
bark, or give back the drowned mariner to his weeping wife and children; 
neither would my solving deep mysteries avail me a single whit, for 
the least love to God, and the simplest act of obedience to him, are 
better than the profoundest knowledge. My Lord, I leave the infinite 
to thee, and pray thee to put far from me such a love for the tree 
of knowledge as might keep me from the tree of life.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0906am-p3">We use lights to <i>make manifest</i>. A Christian man should so shine in his life, that a person could 
not live with him a week without knowing the gospel. His conversation 
should be such that all who are about him should clearly perceive 
whose he is, and whom he serves; and should see the image of Jesus 
reflected in his daily actions. Lights are intended for <i>guidance</i>. We are to help those around us who are in the dark. We are to hold 
forth to them the Word of life. We are to point sinners to the Saviour, 
and the weary to a divine resting-place. Men sometimes read their 
Bibles, and fail to understand them; we should be ready, like Philip, 
to instruct the inquirer in the meaning of God’s Word, the way of salvation, and the life of godliness. Lights are 
also used for <i>warning</i>. On our rocks and shoals a light-house is sure to be erected. Christian 
men should know that there are many false lights shown everywhere 
in the world, and therefore the right light is needed. The wreckers 
of Satan are always abroad, tempting the ungodly to sin under the 
name of pleasure; they hoist the wrong light, be it ours to put up 
the true light upon every dangerous rock, to point out every sin, 
and tell what it leads to, that so we may be clear of the blood of 
all men, shining as lights in the world. Lights also have a very <i>cheering</i> influence, and so have Christians. A Christian ought to be a comforter, 
with kind words on his lips, and sympathy in his heart; he should 
carry sunshine wherever he goes, and diffuse happiness around him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0906pm-p3">He who looks at his own character and position from a legal point 
of view, will not only despair when he comes to the <i>end</i> of his reckoning, but if he be a wise man he will despair at the 
<i>beginning</i>; for if we are to be judged on the footing of the law, there shall 
no flesh living be justified. How blessed to know that we dwell in 
the domains of grace and not of law! When thinking of my state before 
God the question is not, “Am I perfect in myself before the law?” but, “Am I perfect in Christ Jesus?” That is a very different matter. We need not enquire, “Am I without sin naturally?” but, “Have I been washed in the fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness?” It is not “Am I in myself well pleasing to God?” but it is “Am I accepted in the Beloved?” The Christian views his evidences from the top of Sinai, and grows 
alarmed concerning his salvation; it were better far if he read his 
title by the light of Calvary. “Why,” saith he, “my faith has unbelief in it, it is not able to save me.” Suppose he had considered <i>the object</i> of his faith instead of his faith, then he would have said, “There is no failure in <i>him</i>, and therefore I am safe.” He sighs over his hope: “Ah! my hope is marred and dimmed by an anxious carefulness about present 
things; how can I be accepted?” Had he regarded <i>the ground</i> of his hope, he would have seen that the promise of God standeth 
sure, and that whatever our doubts may be, the oath and promise never 
fail. Ah! believer, it is safer always for you to be led of the Spirit 
into gospel liberty than to wear legal fetters. Judge yourself at 
what <i>Christ</i> is rather than at what <i>you</i> are. Satan will try to mar your peace by reminding you of your sinfulness 
and imperfections: you can only meet his accusations by faithfully 
adhering to the gospel and refusing to wear the yoke of bondage.</p>

If we cannot get sinners where Jesus is by ordinary methods we must 
use extraordinary ones. It seems, according to <scripRef passage="Lk 5:19" id="d0907am-p3.1" parsed="|Luke|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.5.19">Luke 5:19</scripRef>, that a tiling had to be removed, which would make dust and cause 
a measure of danger to those below, but where the case is very urgent 
we must not mind running some risks and shocking some proprieties. 
Jesus was there to heal, and therefore fall what might, faith ventured 
all so that her poor paralysed charge might have his sins forgiven.

man: is not the Lord among us now? Have we seen his face for ourselves 
this morning? Have we felt his healing power in our own souls? If 
so, then through door, through window, or through roof, let us, breaking 
through all impediments, labour to bring poor souls to Jesus. All 
means are good and decorous when faith and love are truly set on winning 
souls. If hunger for bread can break through stone walls, surely hunger 
for souls is not to be hindered in its efforts. O Lord, make us quick 
to suggest methods of reaching thy poor sin-sick ones, and bold to 
carry them out at all hazards.</p>

are safe in our quiet chamber, but far away on the salt sea the hurricane 
may be cruelly seeking for the lives of men. Hear how the death fiends 
howl among the cordage; how every timber starts as the waves beat 
like battering rams upon the vessel! God help you, poor drenched and 
wearied ones! My prayer goes up to the great Lord of sea and land, 
that he will make the storm a calm, and bring you to your desired 
haven! Nor ought I to offer prayer alone, I should try to benefit 
those hardy men who risk their lives so constantly. Have I ever done 
anything for them? What can I do? How often does the boisterous sea 
swallow up the mariner! Thousands of corpses lie where pearls lie 
deep. There is death-sorrow on the sea, which is echoed in the long 
wail of widows and orphans. The salt of the sea is in many eyes of 
mothers and wives. Remorseless billows, ye have devoured the love 
of women, and the stay of households. What a resurrection shall there 
be from the caverns of the deep when the sea gives up her dead! Till 
then there will be sorrow on the sea. As if in sympathy with the woes 
of earth, the sea is forever fretting along a thousand shores, wailing 
with a sorrowful cry like her own birds, booming with a hollow crash 
of unrest, raving with uproarious discontent, chafing with hoarse 
wrath, or jangling with the voices of ten thousand murmuring pebbles. 
The roar of the sea may be joyous to a rejoicing spirit, but to the 
son of sorrow the wide, wide ocean is even more forlorn than the wide, 
wide world. This is not our rest, and the restless billows tell us 
so. There is a land where there is no more sea—our faces are steadfastly set towards it; we are going to the place 
of which the Lord hath spoken. Till then, we cast our sorrows on the 
Lord who trod the sea of old, and who maketh a way for his people 
through the depths thereof.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0908am-p3">Our fruit is found from our God as to <i>union</i>. The fruit of the branch is directly traceable to the root. Sever 
the connection, the branch dies, and no fruit is produced. By virtue 
of our union with Christ we bring forth fruit. Every bunch of grapes 
has been first in the root, it has passed through the stem, and flowed 
through the sap vessels, and fashioned itself externally into fruit, 
but it was first in the stem; so also every good work was first in 
Christ, and then is brought forth in us. O Christian, prize this precious 
union to Christ; for it must be the source of all the fruitfulness 
which thou canst hope to know. If thou wert not joined to Jesus Christ, 
thou wouldst be a barren bough indeed.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0908am-p4">Our fruit comes from God as to <i>spiritual providence</i>. When the dew-drops fall from heaven, when the cloud looks down from 
on high, and is about to distil its liquid treasure, when the bright 
sun swells the berries of the cluster, each heavenly boon may whisper 
to the tree and say, “From me is thy fruit found.” The fruit owes much to the root—that is essential to fruitfulness—but it owes very much also to external influences. How much we owe 
to God’s grace-providence! in which he provides us constantly with quickening, 
teaching, consolation, strength, or whatever else we want. To this 
we owe our all of usefulness or virtue.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0908am-p5">Our fruit comes from God as to <i>wise husbandry</i>. The gardener’s sharp-edged knife promotes the fruitfulness of the tree, by thinning 
the clusters, and by cutting off superfluous shoots. So is it, Christian, 
with that pruning which the Lord gives to thee. “My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit 
he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, 
that it may bring forth more fruit.” Since our God is the author of our spiritual graces, let us give 
to him all the glory of our salvation.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0908pm-p3">In the resurrection of Christ, as in our salvation, there was put 
forth nothing short of <i>a divine power</i>. What shall we say of those who think that conversion is wrought 
by the free will of man, and is due to his own betterness of disposition? 
When we shall see the dead rise from the grave by their own power, 
then may we expect to see ungodly sinners of their own free will turning 
to Christ. It is not the word preached, nor the word read in itself; 
all quickening power proceeds from the Holy Ghost. This power was 
<i>irresistible</i>. All the soldiers and the high priests could not keep the body of 
Christ in the tomb; Death himself could not hold Jesus in his bonds: 
even thus irresistible is the power put forth in the believer when 
he is raised to newness of life. No sin, no corruption, no devils 
in hell nor sinners upon earth, can stay the hand of God’s grace when it intends to convert a man. If God omnipotently says, 
“Thou shalt,” man shall not say, “I will not.” Observe that the power which raised Christ from the dead was <i>glorious</i>. It reflected honour upon God and wrought dismay in the hosts of 
evil. So there is great glory to God in the conversion of every sinner. 
It was <i>everlasting power</i>. “Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more 
dominion over him.” So we, being raised from the dead, go not back to our dead works 
nor to our old corruptions, but we live unto God. “Because he lives we live also.” “For we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God.” “Like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, 
even so we also should walk in newness of life.” Lastly, in the text mark <i>the union of the new life</i> <i>to Jesus</i>. The same power which raised the Head works life in the members. 
What a blessing to be quickened together with Christ!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0909am-p3">There are different translations of these words. One version renders 
it, “I will shew thee great and fortified things.” Another, “Great and reserved things.” Now, there are reserved and special things in Christian experience: 
all the developments of spiritual life are not alike easy of attainment. 
There are the common frames and feelings of repentance, and faith, 
and joy, and hope, which are enjoyed by the entire family; but there 
is an upper realm of rapture, of communion, and conscious union with 
Christ, which is far from being the common dwelling-place of believers. 
We have not all the high privilege of John, to lean upon Jesus’ bosom; nor of Paul, to be caught up into the third heaven. There are heights in experimental knowledge of 
the things of God which the eagle’s eye of acumen and philosophic thought hath never seen: God alone 
can bear us there; but the chariot in which he takes us up, and the 
fiery steeds with which that chariot is dragged, are prevailing prayers. 
Prevailing prayer is victorious over the God of mercy, “By his strength he had power with God: yea, he had power over the 
angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he 
found him in Beth-el, and there he spake with us.” Prevailing prayer takes the Christian to Carmel, and enables him 
to cover heaven with clouds of blessing, and earth with floods of 
mercy. Prevailing prayer bears the Christian aloft to Pisgah, and 
shows him the inheritance reserved; it elevates us to Tabor and transfigures 
us, till in the likeness of his Lord, as he is, so are we also in 
this world. If you would reach to something higher than ordinary grovelling 
experience, look to the Rock that is higher than you, and gaze with 
the eye of faith through the window of importunate prayer. When you 
open the window on your side, it will not be bolted on the other.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0909pm-p3">These representatives of the saints in heaven are said to be <i>around the throne</i>. In the passage in Canticles, where Solomon sings of the King sitting 
at his table, some render it “a round table.” From this, some expositors, I think, without straining the text, 
have said, “There is an equality among the saints.” That idea is conveyed by the equal nearness of the four and twenty 
elders. The condition of glorified spirits in heaven is that of nearness 
to Christ, clear vision of his glory, constant access to his court, 
and familiar fellowship with his person: nor is there any difference 
in this respect between one saint and another, but all the people 
of God, apostles, martyrs, ministers, or private and obscure Christians, 
shall all be seated <i>near the throne</i>, where they shall forever gaze upon their exalted Lord, and be satisfied 
with his love. They shall all be near to Christ, all ravished with 
his love, all eating and drinking at the same table with him, all 
equally beloved as his favourites and friends even if not all equally 
rewarded as servants.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0909pm-p4">Let believers on earth imitate the saints in heaven in their nearness 
to Christ. Let us on earth be as the elders are in heaven, sitting 
around the throne. May Christ be the object of our thoughts, the centre 
of our lives. How can we endure to live at such a distance from our 
Beloved? Lord Jesus, draw us nearer to thyself. Say unto us, “Abide in me, and I in you”; and permit us to sing, “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0910am-p3">Here was sovereignty. Impatient spirits may fret and fume, because 
they are not called to the highest places in the ministry; but reader 
be it thine to rejoice that Jesus calleth whom he wills. If he shall 
leave me to be a doorkeeper in his house, I will cheerfully bless 
him for his grace in permitting me to do anything in his service. 
The call of Christ’s servants comes from above. Jesus stands on the mountain, evermore 
above the world in holiness, earnestness, love and power. Those whom 
he calls must go up the mountain to him, they must seek to rise to 
his level by living in constant communion with him. They may not be 
able to mount to classic honours, or attain scholastic eminence, but 
they must like Moses go up into the mount of God and have familiar 
intercourse with the unseen God, or they will never be fitted to proclaim 
the gospel of peace. Jesus went apart to hold high fellowship with 
the Father, and we must enter into the same divine companionship if 
we would bless our fellowmen. No wonder that the apostles were clothed 
with power when they came down fresh from the mountain where Jesus 
was. This morning we must endeavour to ascend the mount of communion, 
that there we may be ordained to the lifework for which we are set 
apart. Let us not see the face of man today till we have seen Jesus. 
Time spent with him is laid out at blessed interest. We too shall 
cast out devils and work wonders if we go down into the world girded 
with that divine energy which Christ alone can give. It is of no use 
going to the Lord’s battle till we are armed with heavenly weapons. We <i>must</i> see Jesus, this is essential. At the mercy-seat we will linger till 
he shall manifest himself unto us as he doth not unto the world, and 
until we can truthfully say, “We were with him in the Holy Mount.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0910pm-p3">While preparing the present volume, this particular expression recurred 
to me so frequently, that in order to be rid of its constant importunity 
I determined to give a page to it. The evening wolf, infuriated by 
a day of hunger, was fiercer and more ravenous than he would have 
been in the morning. May not the furious creature represent our doubts 
and fears after a day of distraction of mind, losses in business, 
and perhaps ungenerous tauntings from our fellow men? How our thoughts 
howl in our ears, “Where is now thy God?” How voracious and greedy they are, swallowing up all suggestions 
of comfort, and remaining as hungry as before. Great Shepherd, slay 
these evening wolves, and bid thy sheep lie down in green pastures, 
undisturbed by insatiable unbelief. How like are the fiends of hell 
to evening wolves, for when the flock of Christ are in a cloudy and 
dark day, and their sun seems going down, they hasten to tear and 
to devour. They will scarcely attack the Christian in the daylight 
of faith, but in the gloom of soul conflict they fall upon him. O 
thou who hast laid down thy life for the sheep, preserve them from 
the fangs of the wolf.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0910pm-p4">False teachers who craftily and industriously hunt for the precious 
life, devouring men by their false-hoods, are as dangerous and detestable 
as evening wolves. Darkness is their element, deceit is their character, 
destruction is their end. We are most in danger from them when they 
wear the sheep’s skin. Blessed is he who is kept from them, for thousands are made 
the prey of grievous wolves that enter within the fold of the church.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0910pm-p5">What a wonder of grace it is when fierce persecutors are converted, 
for then the wolf dwells with the lamb, and men of cruel ungovernable 
dispositions become gentle and teachable. O Lord, convert many such: 
for such we will pray tonight.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0911am-p3">The Christian, while in the world, is not to be of the world. He should 
be distinguished from it in <i>the great object of his</i> <i>life</i>. To him, “to live,” should be “Christ.” Whether he eats, or drinks, or whatever he does, he should do all 
to God’s glory. You may lay up treasure; but lay it up in heaven, where neither 
moth nor rust doth corrupt, where thieves break not through nor steal. 
You may strive to be rich; but be it your ambition to be “rich in faith,” and good works. You may have pleasure; but when you are merry, sing 
psalms and make melody in your hearts to the Lord. In your <i>spirit</i>, as well as in your aim, you should differ from the world. Waiting 
humbly before God, always conscious of his presence, delighting in 
communion with him, and seeking to know his will, you will prove that 
you are of heavenly race. And you should be separate from the world 
in your <i>actions</i>. If a thing be right, though you lose by it, it must be done; if 
it be wrong, though you would gain by it, you must scorn the sin for 
your Master’s sake. You must have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, 
but rather reprove them. Walk worthy of your high calling and dignity. 
Remember, O Christian, that thou art a son of the King of kings. Therefore, 
keep thyself unspotted from the world. Soil not the fingers which 
are soon to sweep celestial strings; let not these eyes become the 
windows of lust which are soon to see the King in his beauty—let not those feet be defiled in miry places, which are soon to walk 
the golden streets—let not those hearts be filled with pride and bitterness which are 
ere long to be filled with heaven, and to overflow with ecstatic joy.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0911pm-p3">Very bitter is the enmity of the world against the people of Christ. 
Men will forgive a thousand faults in others, but they will magnify 
the most trivial offence in the followers of Jesus. Instead of vainly 
regretting this, let us turn it to account, and since so many are 
watching for our halting, let this be a special motive for walking 
very carefully before God. If we live carelessly, the lynx-eyed world 
will soon see it, and with its hundred tongues, it will spread the 
story, exaggerated and emblazoned by the zeal of slander. They will 
shout triumphantly. “Aha! So would we have it! See how these Christians act! They are hypocrites 
to a man.” Thus will much damage be done to the cause of Christ, and much insult 
offered to his name. The cross of Christ is in itself an offence to 
the world; let us take heed that we add no offence of our own. It 
is “to the Jews a stumblingblock”: let us mind that we put no stumblingblocks where there are enough 
already. “To the Greeks it is foolishness”: let us not add our folly to give point to the scorn with which the 
worldly-wise deride the gospel. How jealous should we be of ourselves! 
How rigid with our consciences! In the presence of adversaries who 
will misrepresent our best deeds, and impugn our motives where they 
cannot censure our actions, how circumspect should we be! Pilgrims 
travel as suspected persons through Vanity Fair. Not only are we under 
surveillance, but there are more spies than we know of. The espionage 
is everywhere, at home and abroad. If we fall into the enemies’ hands we may sooner expect generosity from a wolf, or mercy from 
a fiend, than anything like patience with our infirmities from men 
who spice their infidelity towards God with scandals against his people. 
O Lord, lead us ever, lest our enemies trip us up!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0912am-p3"><i>Your Lord is very jealous of your love</i>, O believer. Did he choose you? He cannot bear that you should choose 
another. Did he buy you with his own blood? He cannot endure that 
you should think that you are your own, or that you belong to this 
world. He loved you with such a love that he would not stop in heaven 
without you; he would sooner die than you should perish, and he cannot 
endure that anything should stand between your heart’s love and himself. <i>He is very jealous of your trust</i>. He will not permit you to trust in an arm of flesh. He cannot bear 
that you should hew out broken cisterns, when the overflowing fountain 
is always free to you. When we lean upon him, he is glad, but when 
we transfer our dependence to another, when we rely upon our own wisdom, 
or the wisdom of a friend—worst of all, when we trust in any works of our own, he is displeased, 
and will chasten us that he may bring us to himself. <i>He is also very jealous of our company</i>. There should be no one with whom we converse so much as with Jesus. 
To abide in him only, this is true love; but to commune with the world, 
to find sufficient solace in our carnal comforts, to prefer even the 
society of our fellow Christians to secret intercourse with him, this 
is grievous to our jealous Lord. He would fain have us abide in him, 
and enjoy constant fellowship with himself; and many of the trials 
which he sends us are for the purpose of weaning our hearts from the 
creature, and fixing them more closely upon himself. Let this jealousy 
which would keep us near to Christ <i>be also a comfort</i> to us, for if he loves us so much as to care thus about <i>our</i> love we may be sure that he will suffer nothing to harm us, and will 
protect us from all our enemies. Oh that we may have grace this day 
to keep our hearts in sacred chastity for our Beloved alone, with 
sacred jealousy shutting our eyes to all the fascinations of the world!</p>

wells would be used by the company who came after. We read some book 
full of consolation, which is like Jonathan’s rod, dropping with honey. Ah! we think our brother has been here 
before us, and digged this well for us as well as for himself. Many 
a “Night of Weeping,” “Midnight Harmonies,” an “Eternal Day,” “A Crook in the Lot,” a “Comfort for Mourners,” has been a well digged by a pilgrim for himself, but has proved quite 
as useful to others. Specially we notice this in the Psalms, such 
as that beginning, “Why art thou cast down, O my soul?” Travellers have been delighted to see the footprint of man on a barren

top instead of the bottom. We use the means, but the blessing does 
not spring from the means. We dig a well, but heaven fills it with 
rain. The horse is prepared against the day of battle, but safety 
is of the Lord. The means are connected with the end, but they do 
not of themselves produce it. See here the rain fills the pools, so 
that the wells become useful as reservoirs for the water; labour is 
not lost, but yet it does not supersede divine help.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0913am-p5">Grace may well be compared to rain for its purity, for its refreshing

the sovereignty with which it is given or withheld. May our readers 
have showers of blessing, and may the wells they have digged be filled 
with water! Oh, what are means and ordinances without the smile of 
heaven! They are as clouds without rain, and pools without water. 
O God of love, open the windows of heaven and pour us out a blessing!</p>

them as jewels in his crown; plucks them as brands from the burning, 
and preserves them as costly monuments of his mercy. None are so precious 
in Jesus’ sight as the sinners for whom he died. When Jesus receives sinners, 
he has not some out-of-doors reception place, no casual ward where 
he charitably entertains them as men do passing beggars, but he opens 
the golden gates of his royal heart, and receives the sinner right 
into himself—yea, he admits the humble penitent into personal union and makes him 
a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. There was never 
such a reception as this! This fact is still most sure this evening, 
he is still receiving sinners: would to God sinners would receive 
him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0914am-p3">Jesus was the Lord High Admiral of the sea that night, and his presence 
preserved the whole convoy. It is well to sail with Jesus, even though 
it be in a little ship. When we sail in Christ’s company, we may not make sure of fair weather, for great storms 
may toss the vessel which carries the Lord himself, and we must not 
expect to find the sea less boisterous around our little boat. If 
we go with Jesus we must be content to fare as he fares; and when 
the waves are rough to him, they will be rough to us. It is by tempest 
and tossing that we shall come to land, as he did before us.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0914am-p4">When the storm swept over Galilee’s dark lake all faces gathered blackness, and all hearts dreaded shipwreck. 
When all creature help was useless, the slumbering Saviour arose, 
and with a word, transformed the riot of the tempest into the deep 
quiet of a calm; then were the little vessels at rest as well as that 
which carried the Lord. Jesus is the star of the sea; and though there 
be sorrow upon the sea, when Jesus is on it there is joy too. May 
our hearts make Jesus their anchor, their rudder, their lighthouse, 
their life-boat, and their harbour. His Church is the Admiral’s flagship, let us attend her movements, and cheer her officers with 
our presence. He himself is the great attraction; let us follow ever 
in his wake, mark his signals, steer by his chart, and never fear 
while he is within hail. Not one ship in the convoy shall suffer wreck; 
the great Commodore will steer every barque in safety to the desired 
haven. By faith we will slip our cable for another day’s cruise, and sail forth with Jesus into a sea of tribulation. Winds 
and waves will not spare us, but they all obey him; and, therefore, 
whatever squalls may occur without, faith shall feel a blessed calm 
within. He is ever in the centre of the weather-beaten company: let 
us rejoice in him. His vessel has reached the haven, and so shall 
ours.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0914pm-p3">David’s grief for sin was bitter. Its effects were visible upon his outward 
frame: “his bones waxed old”; “his moisture was turned into the drought of summer.” No remedy could he find, until he made a full confession before the 
throne of the heavenly grace. He tells us that for a time he kept 
silence, and his heart became more and more filled with grief: like 
a mountain tarn whose outlet is blocked up, his soul was swollen with 
torrents of sorrow. He fashioned excuses; he endeavoured to divert 
his thoughts, but it was all to no purpose; like a festering sore 
his anguish gathered, and as he would not use the lancet of confession, 
his spirit was full of torment, and knew no rest. At last it came 
to this, that he must return unto his God in humble penitence, or 
die outright; so he hastened to the mercy-seat, and there unrolled 
the volume of his iniquities before the all-seeing One, acknowledging 
all the evil of his ways in language such as you read in the fifty-first 
and other penitential Psalms. Having done this, a work so simple and 
yet so difficult to pride, he received at once the token of divine 
forgiveness; the bones which had been broken were made to rejoice, 
and he came forth from his closet to sing the blessedness of the man 
whose transgression is forgiven. See the value of a grace-wrought 
confession of sin! It is to be prized above all price, for in every 
case where there is a genuine, gracious confession, mercy is freely 
given, not because the repentance and confession <i>deserve</i> mercy, but for <i>Christ's</i> <i>sake</i>. Blessed be God, there is always healing for the broken heart; the 
fountain is ever flowing to cleanse us from our sins. Truly, O Lord, 
thou art a God “ready to pardon!” Therefore will we acknowledge our iniquities.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0915am-p3">Christian, you ought not to dread the arrival of evil tidings; because 
if you are distressed by them, <i>what do you</i> <i>more than other men</i>? Other men have not your God to fly to; they have never proved his 
faithfulness as you have done, and it is no wonder if they are bowed 
down with alarm and cowed with fear: but you profess to be of another 
spirit; you have been begotten again unto a lively hope, and your 
heart lives in heaven and not on earthly things; now, if you are seen 
to be distracted as other men, what is the value of that grace which 
you profess to have received? Where is the dignity of that new nature 
which you claim to possess?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0915am-p4">Again, if you should be filled with alarm, as others are, <i>you would, doubtless, be led into the sins so common to others</i> <i>under trying circumstances</i>. The ungodly, when they are overtaken by evil tidings, rebel against 
God; they murmur, and think that God deals hardly with them. Will 
you fall into that same sin? Will you provoke the Lord as they do?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0915am-p5">Moreover, unconverted men often run to wrong means in order to escape 
from difficulties, and you will be sure to do the same if your mind 
yields to the present pressure. Trust in the Lord, and wait patiently 
for him. Your wisest course is to do as Moses did at the Red Sea, 
“Stand still and see the salvation of God.” For if you give way to fear when you hear of evil tidings, you will 
be unable to meet the trouble with that calm composure which nerves 
for duty, and sustains under adversity. How can you glorify God if 
you play the coward? Saints have often sung God’s high praises in the fires, but will your doubting and desponding, 
as if you had none to help you, magnify the Most High? Then take courage, 
and relying in sure confidence upon the faithfulness of your covenant 
God, “let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0915pm-p3">The dispensation of the old covenant was that of distance. When God 
appeared even to his servant Moses, he said, “Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet”; and when he manifested himself upon Mount Sinai, to his own chosen 
and separated people, one of the first commands was, “Thou shalt set bounds about the mount.” Both in the sacred worship of the tabernacle and the temple, the 
thought of distance was always prominent. The mass of the people did 
not even enter the outer court. Into the inner court none but the 
priests might dare to intrude; while into the innermost place, or 
the holy of holies, the high priest entered but once in the year. 
It was as if the Lord in those early ages would teach man that sin 
was so utterly loathsome to him, that he must treat men as lepers 
put without the camp; and when he came nearest to them, he yet made 
them feel the width of the separation between a holy God and an impure 
sinner. When the gospel came, we were placed on quite another footing. 
The word “Go” was exchanged for “Come”; distance was made to give place to nearness, and we who aforetime 
were afar off, were made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ. Incarnate 
Deity has no wall of fire about it. “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest,” is the joyful proclamation of God as he appears in human flesh. Not 
now does he teach the leper his leprosy by setting him at a distance, 
but by himself suffering the penalty of his defilement. What a state 
of safety and privilege is this nearness to God through Jesus! Do 
you know it by experience? If you know it, are you living in the power 
of it? Marvellous is this nearness, yet it is to be followed by a 
dispensation of greater nearness still, when it shall be said, “The tabernacle of God is with men, and he doth dwell among them.” Hasten it, O Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0916am-p3">To be a partaker of the divine nature is not, of course, to become 
God. That cannot be. The essence of Deity is not to be participated 
in by the creature. Between the creature and the Creator there must 
ever be a gulf fixed in respect of essence; but as the first man Adam 
was made in the image of God, so we, by the renewal of the Holy Spirit, 
are in a yet diviner sense made in the image of the Most High, and 
are partakers of the divine nature. We are, by grace, made like God. 
“God is love”; we become love—“He that loveth is born of God.” God is truth; we become true, and we love that which is true: God 
is good, and he makes us good by his grace, so that we become the 
pure in heart who shall see God. Moreover, we become partakers of 
the divine nature in even a higher sense than this—in fact, in as lofty a sense as can be conceived, short of our being 
absolutely divine. Do we not become members of the body of the divine 
person of Christ? Yes, the same blood which flows in the head flows 
in the hand: and the same life which quickens Christ quickens his 
people, for “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” Nay, as if this were not enough, we are married unto Christ. He hath 
betrothed us unto himself in righteousness and in faithfulness, and 
he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. Oh! marvellous mystery! 
we look into it, but who shall understand it? One with Jesus—so one with him that the branch is not more one with the vine than 
we are a part of the Lord, our Saviour, and our Redeemer! While we 
rejoice in this, let us remember that those who are made partakers 
of the divine nature will manifest their high and holy relationship 
in their intercourse with others, and make it evident by their daily 
walk and conversation that they have escaped the corruption that is 
in the world through lust. O for more divine holiness of life!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0916pm-p3">This was a strange question for Job to ask of the Lord. He felt himself 
to be too insignificant to be so strictly watched and chastened, and 
he hoped that he was not so unruly as to need to be so restrained. 
The enquiry was natural from one surrounded with such insupportable 
miseries, but after all, it is capable of a very humbling answer. 
It is true man is not the sea, but he is even more troublesome and 
unruly. The sea obediently respects its boundary, and though it be 
but a belt of sand, it does not overleap the limit. Mighty as it is, 
it hears the divine <i>hitherto</i>, and when most raging with tempest it respects the word; but self-willed 
man defies heaven and oppresses earth, neither is there any end to 
this rebellious rage. The sea, obedient to the moon, ebbs and flows 
with ceaseless regularity, and thus renders an active as well as a 
passive obedience; but man, restless beyond his sphere, sleeps within 
the lines of duty, indolent where he should be active. He will neither 
come nor go at the divine command, but sullenly prefers to do what 
he should not, and to leave undone that which is required of him. 
Every drop in the ocean, every beaded bubble, and every yeasty foam-flake, 
every shell and pebble, feel the power of law, and yield or move at 
once. O that our nature were but one thousandth part as much conformed 
to the will of God! We call the sea fickle and false, but how constant 
it is! Since our fathers’ days, and the old time before them, the sea is where it was, beating 
on the same cliffs to the same tune; we know where to find it, it 
forsakes not its bed, and changes not in its ceaseless boom; but where 
is man-vain, fickle man? Can the wise man guess by what folly he will 
next be seduced from his obedience? We need more watching than the 
billowy sea, and are far more rebellious. Lord, rule us for thine 
own glory. Amen.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0917am-p3">Despairingly the poor disappointed father turned away from the disciples 
to their Master. His son was in the worst possible condition, and 
all means had failed, but the miserable child was soon delivered from 
the evil one when the parent in faith obeyed the Lord Jesus’ word, “Bring him unto me.” Children are a precious gift from God, but much anxiety comes with 
them. They may be a great joy or a great bitterness to their parents; 
they may be filled with the Spirit of God, or possessed with the spirit 
of evil. In all cases, the Word of God gives us one receipt for the 
curing of all their ills, “Bring him unto me.” O for more agonizing prayer on their behalf while they are yet babes! 
Sin is there, let our prayers begin to attack it. Our cries for our 
offspring should precede those cries which betoken their actual advent 
into a world of sin. In the days of their youth we shall see sad tokens 
of that dumb and deaf spirit which will neither pray aright, nor hear 
the voice of God in the soul, but Jesus still commands, “Bring them unto me.” When they are grown up they may wallow in sin and foam with enmity 
against God; then when our hearts are breaking we should remember 
the great Physician’s words, “Bring them unto me.” Never must we cease to pray until they cease to breathe. No case 
is hopeless while Jesus lives.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0917am-p4">The Lord sometimes suffers his people to be driven into a corner that 
they may experimentally know how necessary he is to them. Ungodly 
children, when they show us our own powerlessness against the depravity 
of their hearts, drive us to flee to the strong for strength, and 
this is a great blessing to us. Whatever our morning’s need may be, let it like a strong current bear us to the ocean of 
divine love. Jesus can soon remove our sorrow, he delights to comfort 
us. Let us hasten to him while he waits to meet us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0917pm-p3">God employs his people to encourage one another. He did not say to 
an angel, “Gabriel, my servant Joshua is about to lead my people into Canaan—go, encourage him.” God never works needless miracles; if his purposes can be accomplished 
by ordinary means, he will not use miraculous agency. Gabriel would 
not have been half so well fitted for the work as Moses. A brother’s sympathy is more precious than an angel’s embassy. The angel, swift of wing, had better known the Master’s bidding than the people’s temper. An angel had never experienced the hardness of the road, 
nor seen the fiery serpents, nor had he led the stiff-necked multitude 
in the wilderness as Moses had done. We should be glad that God usually 
works for man by man. It forms a bond of brotherhood, and being mutually 
dependent on one another, we are fused more completely into one family. 
Brethren, take the text as God’s message to you. Labour to help others, and especially strive to 
<i>encourage</i> them. Talk cheerily to the young and anxious enquirer, lovingly try 
to remove stumblingblocks out of his way. When you find a spark of 
grace in the heart, kneel down and blow it into a flame. Leave the 
young believer to discover the roughness of the road by degrees, but 
tell him of the strength which dwells in God, of the sureness of the 
promise, and of the charms of communion with Christ. Aim to comfort 
the sorrowful, and to animate the desponding. Speak a word in season 
to him that is weary, and encourage those who are fearful to go on 
their way with gladness. God encourages you by his promises; Christ 
encourages you as he points to the heaven he has won for you, and 
the spirit encourages <i>you</i> as he works in you to will and to do of his own will and pleasure. 
Imitate divine wisdom, and encourage others, according to the word 
of this evening.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0918am-p3">The two most important things in our holy religion are the <i>life of faith</i> and the <i>walk of faith</i>. He who shall rightly understand these is not far from being a master 
in experimental theology, for they are vital points to a Christian. 
You will never find true faith unattended by true godliness; on the 
other hand, you will never discover a truly holy life which has not 
for its root a living faith upon the righteousness of Christ. Woe 
unto those who seek after the one without the other! There are some 
who cultivate faith and forget holiness; these may be very high in 
orthodoxy, but they shall be very deep in condemnation, for they hold 
the truth in unrighteousness; and there are others who have strained 
after holiness of life, but have denied the faith, like the Pharisees 
of old, of whom the Master said, they were “whitewashed sepulchres.” We must have faith, for this is the foundation; we must have holiness 
of life, for this is the superstructure. Of what service is the mere 
foundation of a building to a man in the day of tempest? Can he hide 
himself therein? He wants a house to cover him, as well as a foundation 
for that house. Even so we need the superstructure of spiritual life 
if we would have comfort in the day of doubt. But seek not a holy 
life without faith, for that would be to erect a house which can afford 
no permanent shelter, because it has no foundation on a rock. Let 
faith and life be put together, and, like the two abutments of an 
arch, they will make our piety enduring. Like light and heat streaming 
from the same sun, they are alike full of blessing. Like the two pillars 
of the temple, they are for glory and for beauty. They are two streams 
from the fountain of grace; two lamps lit with holy fire; two olive 
trees watered by heavenly care. O Lord, give us this day life within, 
and it will reveal itself without to thy glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0918pm-p3">We should follow our Lord as unhesitatingly as sheep follow their 
shepherd, for <i>he has a right to lead us wherever he</i> <i>pleases</i>. We are not our own, we are bought with a price—let us recognize the rights of the redeeming blood. The soldier follows 
his captain, the servant obeys his master, much more must we follow 
our Redeemer, to whom we are a purchased possession. We are not true 
to our profession of being Christians, if we question the bidding 
of our Leader and Commander. Submission is our duty, cavilling is 
our folly. Often might our Lord say to us as to Peter, “What is that to thee? Follow thou me.” Wherever Jesus may lead us, <i>he goes before</i> <i>us</i>. If we know not where we go, we know with whom we go. With such a 
companion, who will dread the perils of the road? The journey may 
be long, but his everlasting arms will carry us to the end. The presence 
of Jesus is the assurance of eternal salvation, because he lives, 
we shall live also. We should follow Christ in simplicity and faith, 
because <i>the paths in</i> <i>which he leads us all end in glory and immortality</i>. It is true they may not be smooth paths—they may be covered with sharp flinty trials, but they lead to the 
“city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.” “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his 
covenant.” Let us put full trust in our Leader, since we know that, come prosperity 
or adversity, sickness or health, popularity or contempt, his purpose 
shall be worked out, and that purpose shall be pure, unmingled good 
to every heir of mercy. We shall find it sweet to go up the bleak 
side of the hill with Christ; and when rain and snow blow into our 
faces, his dear love will make us far more blest than those who sit 
at home and warm their hands at the world’s fire. To the top of Amana, to the dens of lions, or to the hills 
of leopards, we will follow our Beloved. Precious Jesus, draw us, 
and we will run after thee.</p>

Here is a choice passage, believer, “When thou passest through the rivers, I will be with thee.” You are free to that. Here is another: “The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness 
shall not depart from thee”; you are free to that. You are a welcome guest at the table of the 
promises. Scripture is a never-failing treasury filled with boundless 
stores of grace. It is the bank of heaven; you may draw from it as 
much as you please, without let or hindrance. Come in faith and you 
are welcome to all <i>covenant blessings</i>. There is not a promise in the Word which shall be withheld. In the 
depths of tribulations let this freedom comfort you; amidst waves 
of distress let it cheer you; when sorrows surround thee let it be 
thy solace. This is thy Father’s love-token; thou art free to it at all times. Thou art also <i>free to the throne of</i> <i>grace</i>. It is the believer’s privilege to have access at all times to his heavenly Father. Whatever 
our desires, our difficulties, our wants, we are at liberty to spread 
all before him. It matters not how much we may have sinned, we may 
ask and expect pardon. It signifies nothing how poor we are, we may 
plead his promise that he will provide all things needful. We have 
permission to approach his throne at all times—in midnight’s darkest hour, or in noontide’s most burning heat. Exercise thy right, O believer, and live up to 
thy privilege. Thou art free to all that is treasured up <i>in Christ</i>—wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It matters 
not what thy need is, for there is fulness of supply in Christ, and 
it is there <i>for thee</i>. O what a “freedom” is thine! freedom from condemnation, freedom to the promises, freedom 
to the throne of grace, and at last freedom to enter heaven!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0919pm-p3">Devout souls delight to look upon those mercies which they have obtained 
in answer to supplication, for they can see God’s especial love in them. When we can name our blessings Samuel, that 
is, “asked of God,” they will be as dear to us as her child was to Hannah. Peninnah had 
many children, but they came as common blessings unsought in prayer: 
Hannah’s one heaven-given child was dearer far, because he was the fruit 
of earnest pleadings. How sweet was that water to Samson which he 
found at “the well of him that prayed!” Quassia cups turn all waters bitter, but the cup of prayer puts a 
sweetness into the draughts it brings. Did we pray for the conversion 
of our children? How doubly sweet, when they are saved, to see in 
them our own petitions fulfilled! Better to rejoice over them as the 
fruit of our pleadings than as the fruit of our bodies. Have we sought 
of the Lord some choice spiritual gift? When it comes to us it will 
be wrapped up in the gold cloth of God’s faithfulness and truth, and so be doubly precious. Have we petitioned 
for success in the Lord’s work? How joyful is the prosperity which comes flying upon the wings 
of prayer! It is always best to get blessings into our house in the 
legitimate way, by the door of prayer; then they are blessings indeed, 
and not temptations. Even when prayer speeds not, the blessings grow 
all the richer for the delay; the child Jesus was all the more lovely 
in the eyes of Mary when she found him after having sought him sorrowing. 
That which we win by prayer we should dedicate to God, as Hannah dedicated 
Samuel. The gift came from heaven, let it go to heaven. Prayer brought 
it, gratitude sang over it, let devotion consecrate it. Here will 
be a special occasion for saying, “Of thine own have I given unto thee.” Reader, is prayer your element or your weariness? Which?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0920am-p3">Gideon ordered his men to do two things: covering up a torch in an 
earthen pitcher, he bade them, at an appointed signal, break the pitcher 
and let the light shine, and then sound with the trumpet, crying, 
“The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon! the sword of the Lord, and of 
Gideon!” This is precisely what all Christians must do. First, <i>you must shine</i>; break the pitcher which conceals your light; throw aside the bushel 
which has been hiding your candle, and shine. Let your light shine 
before men; let your good works be such, that when men look upon you, 
they shall know that you have been with Jesus. Then <i>there must be</i> <i>the sound</i>, the blowing of the trumpet. There must be active exertions for the 
ingathering of sinners by proclaiming Christ crucified. Take the gospel 
to them; carry it to their door; put it in their way; do not suffer 
them to escape it; blow the trumpet right against their ears. Remember 
that the true war-cry of the Church is Gideon’s watchword, “<i>The sword of the Lord</i>, and of Gideon!” God must do it, it is his own work. But we are not to be idle; instrumentality 
is to be used—“The sword of the Lord, <i>and of Gideon</i>!” If we only cry, “The sword of the Lord!” we shall be guilty of an idle presumption; and if we shout, “The sword of Gideon!” alone, we shall manifest idolatrous reliance on an arm of flesh: 
we must blend the two in practical harmony, “The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!” We can do nothing of ourselves, but we can do everything by the help 
of our God; let us, therefore, in his name determine to go out personally 
and serve with our flaming torch of holy example, and with our trumpet 
tones of earnest declaration and testimony, and God shall be with 
us, and Midian shall be put to confusion, and the Lord of hosts shall 
reign forever and ever.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0920pm-p3">In <i>the evening of the day</i> opportunities are plentiful: men return from their labour, and the 
zealous soul-winner finds time to tell abroad the love of Jesus. Have 
I no evening work for Jesus? If I have not, let me no longer withhold 
my hand from a service which requires abundant labour. Sinners are 
perishing for lack of knowledge; he who loiters may find his skirts 
crimson with the blood of souls. Jesus gave both his hands to the 
nails, how can I keep back one of mine from his blessed work? Night 
and day he toiled and prayed for me, how can I give a single hour 
to the pampering of my flesh with luxurious ease? Up, idle heart; 
stretch out thy hand to work, or uplift it to pray; heaven and hell 
are in earnest, let me be so, and this evening sow good seed for the 
Lord my God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0920pm-p4"><i>The evening of life</i> has also its calls. Life is so short that a morning of manhood’s vigour, and an evening of decay, make the whole of it. To some it 
seems long, but a four-pence is a great sum of money to a poor man. 
Life is so brief that no man can afford to lose a day. It has been 
well said that if a great king should bring us a great heap of gold, 
and bid us take as much as we could count in a day, we should make 
a long day of it; we should begin early in the morning, and in the 
evening we should not withhold our hand; but to win souls is far nobler 
work, how is it that we so soon withdraw from it? Some are spared 
to a long evening of green old age; if such be my case, let me use 
such talents as I still retain, and to the last hour serve my blessed 
and faithful Lord. By his grace I will die in harness, and lay down 
my charge only when I lay down my body. Age may instruct the young, 
cheer the faint, and encourage the desponding; if eventide has less 
of vigorous heat, it should have more of calm wisdom, therefore in 
the evening I will not withhold my hand.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0921am-p3">How heart-cheering to the believer is the delight which God has in 
his saints! We cannot see any reason in ourselves why the Lord should 
take pleasure in us; we cannot take delight in ourselves, for we often 
have to groan, being burdened; conscious of our sinfulness, and deploring 
our unfaithfulness; and we fear that God’s people cannot take much delight in us, for they must perceive so 
much of our imperfections and our follies, that they may rather lament 
our infirmities than admire our graces. But we love to dwell upon 
this transcendent truth, this glorious mystery: that as the bridegroom 
rejoiceth over the bride, so does the Lord rejoice over us. We do 
not read anywhere that God delighteth in the cloud-capped mountains, 
or the sparkling stars, but we do read that he delighteth in the habitable 
parts of the earth, and that his delights are with the sons of men. 
We do not find it written that even angels give his soul delight; 
nor doth he say, concerning cherubim and seraphim, “Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, for the Lord delighteth in thee”; but he does say all that to poor fallen creatures like ourselves, 
debased and depraved by sin, but saved, exalted, and glorified by 
his grace. In what strong language he expresses his delight in his 
people! Who could have conceived of the eternal One as bursting forth 
into a song? Yet it is written, “He will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will 
joy over thee with singing.” As he looked upon the world he had made, he said, “It is very good”; but when he beheld those who are the purchase of Jesus’ blood, his own chosen ones, it seemed as if the great heart of the Infinite could 
restrain itself no longer, but overflowed in divine exclamations of 
joy. Should not we utter our grateful response to such a marvellous 
declaration of his love, and sing, “I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation?”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0921pm-p3">Fear made David pray thus, for something whispered, “Perhaps, after all, thou mayst be gathered with the wicked.” That fear, although marred by unbelief, springs, in the main, from 
holy anxiety, arising from the recollection of past sin. Even the 
pardoned man will enquire, “What if at the end my sins should be remembered, and I should be left 
out of the catalogue of the saved?” He recollects his present unfruitfulness—so little grace, so little love, so little holiness, and looking forward 
to the future, he considers his weakness and the many temptations 
which beset him, and he fears that he may fall, and become a prey 
to the enemy. A sense of sin and present evil, and his prevailing 
corruptions, compel him to pray, in fear and trembling, “Gather not my soul with sinners.” Reader, if you have prayed this prayer, and if your character be 
rightly described in the Psalm from which it is taken, you need not 
be afraid that you shall be gathered with sinners. Have you the two 
virtues which David had—the outward walking in integrity, and the inward trusting in the Lord? 
Are you resting upon Christ’s sacrifice, and can you compass the altar of God with humble hope? 
If so, rest assured, with the wicked you never shall be gathered, 
for that calamity is impossible. The gathering at the judgment is 
like to like. “Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn 
them: but gather the wheat into my barn.” If, then, thou art <i>like</i> God’s people, thou shalt be <i>with</i> God’s people. You cannot be gathered with the wicked, for you are too 
dearly bought. Redeemed by the blood of Christ, you are his forever, 
and where he is, there must his people be. You are loved too much 
to be cast away with reprobates. Shall one dear to Christ perish? 
Impossible! Hell cannot hold thee! Heaven claims thee! Trust in thy 
Surety and fear not!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0922am-p3">Be glad of heart, O believer, but take care that thy gladness has 
its spring <i>in the Lord</i>. Thou hast much cause for gladness in thy God, for thou canst sing 
with David, “God, my exceeding joy.” Be glad that the Lord reigneth, that Jehovah is King! Rejoice that 
he sits upon the throne, and ruleth all things! Every attribute of 
God should become a fresh ray in the sunlight of our gladness. That 
he is wise should make us glad, knowing as we do our own foolishness. 
That he is <i>mighty</i>, should cause us to rejoice who tremble at our weakness. That he 
is everlasting, should always be a theme of joy when we know that 
we wither as the grass. That he is <i>unchanging</i>, should perpetually yield us a song, since <i>we</i> change every hour. That he is full of grace, that he is overflowing 
with it, and that this grace in covenant he has given to us; that 
it is ours to cleanse us, ours to keep us, ours to sanctify us, ours 
to perfect us, ours to bring us to glory—all this should tend to make us glad in him. This gladness in God 
is as a deep river; we have only as yet touched its brink, we know 
a little of its clear sweet, heavenly streams, but onward the depth 
is greater, and the current more impetuous in its joy. The Christian 
feels that he may delight himself not only in what God is, but also 
in all that God <i>has done</i> in the past. The Psalms show us that God’s people in olden times were wont to think much of God’s actions, and to have a song concerning each of them. So let God’s people now rehearse the deeds of the Lord! Let them tell of his 
mighty acts, and “sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.” Nor let them ever cease to sing, for as new mercies flow to them 
day by day, so should their gladness in the Lord’s loving acts in providence and in grace show itself in continued 
thanksgiving. Be glad ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord 
your God.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0922pm-p3">Most of us know what it is to be overwhelmed in heart; emptied as 
when a man wipeth a dish and turneth it upside down; submerged and 
thrown on our beam ends like a vessel mastered by the storm. Discoveries 
of inward corruption will do this, if the Lord permits the great deep 
of our depravity to become troubled and cast up mire and dirt. Disappointments 
and heart-breaks will do this when billow after billow rolls over 
us, and we are like a broken shell hurled to and fro by the surf. 
Blessed be God, at such seasons we are not without an all-sufficient 
solace, our God is the harbour of weather-beaten sails, the hospice 
of forlorn pilgrims. Higher than we are is he, his mercy higher than 
our sins, his love higher than our thoughts. It is pitiful to see 
men putting their trust in something lower than themselves; but our 
confidence is fixed upon an exceeding high and glorious Lord. A Rock 
he is since he changes not, and a high Rock, because the tempests 
which overwhelm us roll far beneath at his feet; he is not disturbed 
by them, but rules them at his will. If we get under the shelter of 
this lofty Rock we may defy the hurricane; all is calm under the lee 
of that towering cliff. Alas! such is the confusion in which the troubled 
mind is often cast, that we need piloting to this divine shelter. 
Hence the prayer of the text. O Lord, our God, by thy Holy Spirit, 
teach us the way of faith, lead us into thy rest. The wind blows us 
out to sea, the helm answers not to our puny hand; thou, thou alone 
canst steer us over the bar between yon sunken rocks, safe into the 
fair haven. How dependent we are upon thee—we need thee to bring us to thee. To be wisely directed and steered 
into safety and peace is thy gift, and thine alone. This night be 
pleased to deal well with thy servants.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0923am-p3">What a state of privilege! It includes our <i>justification</i> before God, but the term “acceptance” in the Greek means more than that. It signifies that we are the objects 
of <i>divine</i> <i>complacence</i>, nay, even of <i>divine delight</i>. How marvellous that we, worms, mortals, sinners, should be the objects 
of divine love! But it is only “<i>in the beloved</i>.” Some Christians seem to be accepted in their own experience, at least, 
that is their apprehension. When their spirit is lively, and their 
hopes bright, they think God accepts them, for they feel so high, 
so heavenly-minded, so drawn above the earth! But when their souls 
cleave to the dust, they are the victims of the fear that they are 
no longer accepted. If they could but see that all their high joys 
do not exalt them, and all their low despondencies do not really depress 
them in their Father’s sight, but that they stand accepted in One who never alters, in 
One who is always the beloved of God, always perfect, always without 
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, how much happier they would be, 
and how much more they would honour the Saviour! Rejoice then, believer, 
in this: thou art accepted “in the beloved.” Thou lookest within, and thou sayest, “There is nothing acceptable <i>here</i>!” But look at Christ, and see if there is not everything acceptable 
<i>there</i>. Thy sins trouble thee; but God has cast thy sins behind his back, 
and thou art accepted in the Righteous One. Thou hast to fight with 
corruption, and to wrestle with temptation, but thou art already accepted 
in him who has overcome the powers of evil. The devil tempts thee; 
be of good cheer, he cannot destroy thee, for thou art accepted in 
him who has broken Satan’s head. Know by full assurance thy glorious standing. Even glorified 
souls are not more accepted than thou art. They are only accepted 
in heaven “in the beloved,” and thou art even now accepted in Christ after the same manner.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0923pm-p3">A certain man had a demoniac son, who was afflicted with a dumb spirit. 
The father, having seen the futility of the endeavours of the disciples 
to heal his child, had little or no faith in Christ, and therefore, 
when he was bidden to bring his son to him, he said to Jesus, “If thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.” Now there was an “if” in the question, but the poor trembling father had put the “if” in the wrong place: Jesus Christ, therefore, without commanding him 
to retract the “if,” kindly puts it in its legitimate position. “Nay, verily,” he seemed to say, “there should be no ‘if’ about my power, nor concerning my willingness, the ‘if’ lies somewhere else.” “<i>If thou canst believe</i>, all things are possible to him that believeth.” The man’s trust was strengthened, he offered a humble prayer for an increase 
of faith, and instantly Jesus spoke the word, and the devil was cast 
out, with an injunction never to return. There is a lesson here which 
we need to learn. We, like this man, often see that there is an “if” somewhere, but we are perpetually blundering by putting it in the 
wrong place. “<i>If</i>” Jesus can help me—“<i>if</i>” he can give me grace to overcome temptation—“<i>if</i>” he can give me pardon—“<i>if</i>” he can make me successful? Nay, “<i>if</i>” you can believe, he both can and will. You have misplaced your “if.” If you can confidently trust, even as all things are possible to 
Christ, so shall all things be possible to you. Faith standeth in 
God’s power, and is robed in God’s majesty; it weareth the royal apparel, and rideth on the King’s horse, for it is the grace which the King delighteth to honour. 
Girding itself with the glorious might of the all-working Spirit, 
it becomes, in the omnipotence of God, mighty to do, to dare, and 
to suffer. All things, without limit, are possible to him that believeth. 
My soul, canst thou believe thy Lord tonight?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0924am-p3">A convoy on many accounts would have been desirable for the pilgrim 
band, but a holy shame-facedness would not allow Ezra to seek one. 
He feared lest the heathen king should think his professions of faith 
in God to be mere hypocrisy, or imagine that the God of Israel was 
not able to preserve his own worshippers. He could not bring his mind 
to lean on an arm of flesh in a matter so evidently of the Lord, and 
therefore the caravan set out with no visible protection, guarded 
by him who is the sword and shield of his people. It is to be feared 
that few believers feel this holy jealousy for God; even those who 
in a measure walk by faith, occasionally mar the lustre of their life 
by craving aid from man. It is a most blessed thing to have no props 
and no buttresses, but to stand upright on the Rock of Ages, upheld 
by the Lord alone. Would any believers seek state endowments for their 
Church, if they remembered that the Lord is dishonoured by their asking 
Caesar’s aid? as if the Lord could not supply the needs of his own cause! 
Should we run so hastily to friends and relations for assistance, 
if we remembered that the Lord is magnified by our implicit reliance 
upon his solitary arm? My soul, wait thou only upon God. “But,” says one, “are not means to be used?” Assuredly they are; but our fault seldom lies in their neglect: far 
more frequently it springs out of foolishly believing in them instead 
of believing in God. Few run too far in neglecting the creature’s arm; but very many sin greatly in making too much of it. Learn, 
dear reader, to glorify the Lord by leaving means untried, if by using 
them thou wouldst dishonour the name of the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0924pm-p3">Paradoxes abound in Christian experience, and here is one—the spouse was asleep, and yet she was awake. He only can read the 
believer’s riddle who has ploughed with the heifer of his experience. The two 
points in this evening’s text are—a mournful sleepiness and a hopeful wakefulness. I <i>sleep</i>. Through sin that dwelleth in us we may become lax in holy duties, 
slothful in religious exercises, dull in spiritual joys, and altogether 
supine and careless. This is a shameful state for one in whom the 
quickening Spirit dwells; and it is dangerous to the highest degree. 
Even wise virgins sometimes slumber, but it is high time for all to 
shake off the bands of sloth. It is to be feared that many believers 
lose their strength as Samson lost his locks, while sleeping on the 
lap of carnal security. With a perishing world around us, to sleep 
is cruel; with eternity so near at hand, it is madness. Yet we are 
none of us so much awake as we should be; a few thunder-claps would 
do us all good, and it may be, unless we soon bestir ourselves, we 
shall have them in the form of war, or pestilence, or personal bereavements 
and losses. O that we may leave forever the couch of fleshly ease, 
and go forth with flaming torches to meet the coming Bridegroom! <i>My heart waketh</i>. This is a happy sign. Life is not extinct, though sadly smothered. 
When our renewed heart struggles against our natural heaviness, we 
should be grateful to sovereign grace for keeping a little vitality 
within the body of this death. Jesus will hear our hearts, will help 
our hearts, will visit our hearts; for the voice of the wakeful heart 
is really the voice of our Beloved, saying, “Open to me.” Holy zeal will surely unbar the door.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0925am-p3">Being justified by faith, we have peace with God. Conscience accuses 
no longer. Judgment now decides for the sinner instead of against 
him. Memory looks back upon past sins, with deep sorrow for the sin, 
but yet with no dread of any penalty to come; for Christ has paid 
the debt of his people to the last jot and tittle, and received the 
divine receipt; and unless God can be so unjust as to demand double 
payment for one debt, no soul for whom Jesus died as a substitute 
can ever be cast into hell. It seems to be one of the very principles 
of our enlightened nature to believe that God is just; we feel that 
it must be so, and this gives us our terror at first; but is it not 
marvellous that this very same belief that God is just, becomes afterwards 
the pillar of our confidence and peace! If God be just, I, a sinner, 
alone and without a substitute, must be punished; but Jesus stands 
in my stead and is punished for me; and now, if God be just, I, a 
sinner, standing in Christ, can never be punished. God must change 
his nature before one soul, for whom Jesus was a substitute, can ever 
by any possibility suffer the lash of the law. Therefore, Jesus having 
taken the place of the believer—having rendered a full equivalent to divine wrath for all that his 
people ought to have suffered as the result of sin, the believer can 
shout with glorious triumph, “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?” Not God, for he hath justified; not Christ, for he hath died, “yea rather hath risen again.” My hope lives not because I am not a sinner, but because I am a sinner 
for whom Christ died; my trust is not that I am holy, but that being 
unholy, <i>he</i> is my righteousness. My faith rests not upon what I am, or shall 
be, or feel, or know, but in what Christ is, in what he has done, 
and in what he is now doing for me. On the lion of justice the fair 
maid of hope rides like a queen.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0925pm-p3">Man’s intellect seeks after rest, and by nature seeks it apart from the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Men of education are apt, even when converted, 
to look upon the simplicities of the cross of Christ with an eye too 
little reverent and loving. They are snared in the old net in which 
the Grecians were taken, and have a hankering to mix philosophy with 
revelation. The temptation with a man of refined thought and high 
education is to depart from the simple truth of Christ crucified, 
and to invent, as the term is, a more <i>intellectual</i> doctrine. This led the early Christian churches into Gnosticism, 
and bewitched them with all sorts of heresies. This is the root of 
Neology, and the other fine things which in days gone by were so fashionable 
in Germany, and are now so ensnaring to certain classes of divines. 
Whoever you are, good reader, and whatever your education may be, 
if you be the Lord's, be assured you will find no rest in philosophizing 
divinity. You may receive this dogma of one great thinker, or that 
dream of another profound reasoner, but what the chaff is to the wheat, 
that will these be to the pure word of God. All that reason, when 
best guided, can find out is but the A B C of truth, and even that 
lacks certainty, while in Christ Jesus there is treasured up all the 
fulness of wisdom and knowledge. All attempts on the part of Christians 
to be content with systems such as Unitarian and Broad-church thinkers 
would approve of, must fail; true heirs of heaven must come back to 
the grandly simple reality which makes the ploughboy’s eye flash with joy, and gladens the pious pauper’s heart—“Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.” Jesus satisfies the most elevated intellect when he is believingly 
received, but apart from him the mind of the regenerate discovers 
no rest. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.” “A good understanding have all they that do his commandments.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0926am-p3">The vision in this chapter describes the condition of Israel in Zechariah’s day; but being interpreted in its aspect towards us, it describes 
the Church of God as we find it now in the world. The Church is compared 
to a myrtle grove flourishing in a valley. It is <i>hidden</i>, unobserved, secreted; courting no honour and attracting no observation 
from the careless gazer. The Church, like her head, has a glory, but 
it is concealed from carnal eyes, for the time of her breaking forth 
in all her splendour is not yet come. The idea of <i>tranquil security</i> is also suggested to us: for the myrtle grove in the valley is still 
and calm, while the storm sweeps over the mountain summits. Tempests 
spend their force upon the craggy peaks of the Alps, but down yonder 
where flows the stream which maketh glad the city of our God, the 
myrtles flourish by the still waters, all unshaken by the impetuous 
wind. How great is the inward tranquility of God’s Church! Even when opposed and persecuted, she has a peace which 
the world gives not, and which, therefore, it cannot take away: the 
peace of God which passeth all understanding keeps the hearts and 
minds of God’s people. Does not the metaphor forcibly picture the peaceful, <i>perpetual</i> <i>growth</i> of the saints? The myrtle sheds not her leaves, she is always green; 
and the Church in her worst time still hath a blessed verdure of grace 
about her; nay, she has sometimes exhibited <i>most</i> verdure when her winter has been sharpest. She has prospered most 
when her adversities have been most severe. Hence the text <i>hints at victory</i>. The myrtle is the emblem of peace, and a significant token of <i>triumph</i>. The brows of conquerors were bound with myrtle and with laurel; 
and is not the Church ever victorious? Is not every Christian more 
than a conqueror through him that loved him? Living in peace, do not 
the saints fall asleep in the arms of victory?</p>

happiness to his enemies, and reserve all the mourning for his own 
family? Shall his foes have mirth and joy, and shall his home-born 
children inherit sorrow and wretchedness? Shall the sinner, who has 
no part in Christ, call himself rich in happiness, and shall we go 
mourning as if we were penniless beggars? No, we will rejoice in the 
Lord always, and glory in our inheritance, for we “have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have 
received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” The rod of chastisement must rest upon us in our measure, but it 
worketh for us the comfortable fruits of righteousness; and therefore 
by the aid of the divine Comforter, we, the “people saved of the Lord,” will joy in the God of our salvation. We are married unto Christ; 
and shall our great Bridegroom permit his spouse to linger in constant 
grief? Our hearts are knit unto him: we are his members, and though 
for awhile we may suffer as our Head once suffered, yet we are even 
now blessed with heavenly blessings in him. We have the earnest of 
our inheritance in the comforts of the Spirit, which are neither few 
nor small. Inheritors of joy forever, we have foretastes of our portion. 
There are streaks of the light of joy to herald our eternal sunrising. 
Our riches are beyond the sea; our city with firm foundations lies 
on the other side the river; gleams of glory from the spirit-world 
cheer our hearts, and urge us onward. Truly is it said of us, “Happy art thou, O Israel; who is like unto thee, O people saved by

Beloved, to tarry when he found himself shut out, and me asleep upon 
the bed of sloth! Oh, the greatness of his patience, to knock and 
knock again, and to add his voice to his knockings, beseeching me 
to open to him! How could I have refused him! Base heart, blush and 
be confounded! But what greatest kindness of all is this, that he 
becomes his own porter and unbars the door himself. Thrice blessed 
is the hand which condescends to lift the latch and turn the key. 
Now I see that nothing but my Lord’s own power can save such a naughty mass of wickedness as I am; ordinances 
fail, even the gospel has no effect upon me, till his hand is stretched 
out. Now, also, I perceive that his hand is good where all else is 
unsuccessful, he can open when nothing else will. Blessed be his name, 
I feel his gracious presence even now. Well may my bowels move for 
him, when I think of all that he has suffered for me, and of my ungenerous 
return. I have allowed my affections to wander. I have set up rivals. 
I have grieved him. Sweetest and dearest of all beloveds, I have treated 
thee as an unfaithful wife treats her husband. Oh, my cruel sins, 
my cruel self. What can I do? Tears are a poor show of my repentance, 
my whole heart boils with indignation at myself. Wretch that I am, 
to treat my Lord, my All in All, my exceeding great joy, as though 
he were a stranger. Jesus, thou forgivest freely, but this is not 
enough, prevent my unfaithfulness in the future. Kiss away these tears, 
and then purge my heart and bind it with sevenfold cords to thyself, 
never to wander more.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0928am-p3">Perhaps no figure of speech represents God in a more gracious light 
than when he is spoken of as stooping from his throne, and coming 
down from heaven to attend to the wants and to behold the woes of 
mankind. We love him, who, when Sodom and Gomorrah were full of iniquity, 
would not destroy those cities until he had made a personal visitation 
of them. We cannot help pouring out our heart in affection for our 
Lord who inclines his ear from the highest glory, and puts it to the 
lip of the dying sinner, whose failing heart longs after reconciliation. 
How can we but love him when we know that he numbers the very hairs 
of our heads, marks our path, and orders our ways? Specially is this 
great truth brought near to our heart, when we recollect how attentive 
he is, not merely to the temporal interests of his creatures, but 
to their spiritual concerns. Though leagues of distance lie between 
the finite creature and the infinite Creator, yet there are links 
uniting both. When a tear is wept by thee, think not that God doth 
not behold; for, “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that 
fear him.” Thy sigh is able to move the heart of Jehovah; thy whisper can incline 
his ear unto thee; thy prayer can stay his hand; thy faith can move 
his arm. Think not that God sits on high taking no account of thee. 
Remember that however poor and needy thou art, yet the Lord thinketh 
upon thee. For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the 
whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart 
is perfect towards him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0928pm-p3">Success is certain when the Lord has promised it. Although you may 
have pleaded month after month without evidence of answer, it is not 
possible that the Lord should be deaf when his people are earnest 
in a matter which concerns his glory. The prophet on the top of Carmel 
continued to wrestle with God, and never for a moment gave way to 
a fear that he should be non-suited in Jehovah’s courts. Six times the servant returned, but on each occasion no 
word was spoken but “Go again.” We must not dream of unbelief, but hold to our faith even to seventy 
times seven. Faith sends expectant hope to look from Carmel’s brow, and if nothing is beheld, she sends again and again. So far 
from being crushed by repeated disappointment, faith is animated to 
plead more fervently with her God. She is humbled, but not abashed: 
her groans are deeper, and her sighings more vehement, but she never 
relaxes her hold or stays her hand. It would be more agreeable to 
flesh and blood to have a speedy answer, but believing souls have 
learned to be submissive, and to find it good to wait <i>for</i> as well as <i>upon</i> the Lord. Delayed answers often set the heart searching itself, and 
so lead to contrition and spiritual reformation: deadly blows are 
thus struck at our corruption, and the chambers of imagery are cleansed. 
The great danger is lest men should faint, and miss the blessing. 
Reader, do not fall into that sin, but continue in prayer and watching. 
At last the little cloud was seen, the sure forerunner of torrents 
of rain, and even so with you, the token for good shall surely be 
given, and you shall rise as a prevailing prince to enjoy the mercy 
you have sought. Elijah was a man of like passions with us: his power 
with God did not lie in his own merits. If his believing prayer availed 
so much, why not yours? Plead the precious blood with unceasing importunity, 
and it shall be with you according to your desire.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0929am-p3">Strange enough this regulation appears, yet there was wisdom in it, 
for the throwing out of the disease proved that the constitution was 
sound. This morning it may be well for us to see the typical teaching 
of so singular a rule. We, too, are lepers, and may read the law of 
the leper as applicable to ourselves. When a man sees himself to be 
altogether lost and ruined, covered all over with the defilement of 
sin, and no part free from pollution; when he disclaims all righteousness 
of his own, and pleads guilty before the Lord, then is he clean through 
the blood of Jesus, and the grace of God. Hidden, unfelt, unconfessed 
iniquity is the true leprosy, but when sin is seen and felt it has 
received its death blow, and the Lord looks with eyes of mercy upon 
the soul afflicted with it. Nothing is more deadly than self-righteousness, 
or more hopeful than contrition. We must confess that we are “nothing else but sin,” for no confession short of this will be the whole truth, and if the 
Holy Spirit be at work with us, convincing us of sin, there will be 
no difficulty about making such an acknowledgment—it will spring spontaneously from our lips. What comfort does the 
text afford to those under a deep sense of sin! Sin mourned and confessed, 
however black and foul, shall never shut a man out from the Lord Jesus. 
Whosoever cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out. Though dishonest 
as the thief, though unchaste as the woman who was a sinner, though 
fierce as Saul of Tarsus, though cruel as Manasseh, though rebellious 
as the prodigal, the great heart of love will look upon the man who 
feels himself to have no soundness in him, and will pronounce him 
clean, when he trusts in Jesus crucified. Come to him, then, poor 
heavy-laden sinner,</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0930am-p3">It is not left to our own option whether we shall praise God or not. 
Praise is God’s most righteous due, and every Christian, as the recipient of his 
grace, is bound to praise God from day to day. It is true we have 
no authoritative rubric for daily praise; we have no commandment prescribing 
certain hours of song and thanksgiving: but the law written upon the 
heart teaches us that it is right to praise God; and the unwritten 
mandate comes to us with as much force as if it had been recorded 
on the tables of stone, or handed to us from the top of thundering 
Sinai. Yes, it is the Christian’s <i>duty</i> to praise God. It is not only a pleasurable exercise, but it is the 
absolute obligation of his life. Think not ye who are always mourning, 
that ye are guiltless in this respect, or imagine that ye can discharge 
your duty to your God without songs of praise. You are bound by the 
bonds of his love to bless his name so long as you live, and his praise 
should continually be in your mouth, for you are blessed, in order 
that you may bless him; “this people have I formed for myself, they shall show forth my praise”; and if you do not praise God, you are not bringing forth the fruit 
which he, as the Divine Husbandman, has a right to expect at your 
hands. Let not your harp then hang upon the willows, but take it down, 
and strive, with a grateful heart, to bring forth its loudest music. 
Arise and chant his praise. With every morning’s dawn, lift up your notes of thanksgiving, and let every setting 
sun be followed with your song. Girdle the earth with your praises; 
surround it with an atmosphere of melody, and God himself will hearken 
from heaven and accept your music.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d0930pm-p3">Life is a precious thing, and in its humblest form it is superior 
to death. This truth is eminently certain in spiritual things. It 
is better to be the least in the kingdom of heaven than the greatest 
out of it. The lowest degree of grace is superior to the noblest development 
of unregenerate nature. Where the Holy Ghost implants divine life 
in the soul, there is a precious deposit which none of the refinements 
of education can equal. The thief on the cross excels Caesar on his 
throne; Lazarus among the dogs is better than Cicero among the senators; 
and the most unlettered Christian is in the sight of God superior 
to Plato. Life is the badge of nobility in the realm of spiritual 
things, and men without it are only coarser or finer specimens of 
the same lifeless material, needing to be quickened, for they are 
dead in trespasses and sins.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d0930pm-p4">A living, loving, gospel sermon, however unlearned in matter and uncouth 
in style, is better than the finest discourse devoid of unction and 
power. A living dog keeps better watch than a dead lion, and is of 
more service to his master; and so the poorest spiritual preacher 
is infinitely to be preferred to the exquisite orator who has no wisdom 
but that of words, no energy but that of sound. The like holds good 
of our prayers and other religious exercises; if we are quickened 
in them by the Holy Spirit, they are acceptable to God through Jesus 
Christ, though we may think them to be worthless things; while our 
grand performances in which our hearts were absent, like dead lions, 
are mere carrion in the sight of the living God. O for living groans, 
living sighs, living despondencies, rather than lifeless songs and 
dead calms. Better anything than death. The snarlings of the dog of 
hell will at least keep us awake, but dead faith and dead profession, 
what greater curses can a man have? Quicken us, quicken us, O Lord!</p>

to make new resolves and carry them out by new labours; our heart 
blossoms with new prayers, and our soul is pledging herself to new 
efforts. But we have some <i>old</i> fruits too. There is our first love: a choice fruit that! and Jesus 
delights in it. There is our first faith: that simple faith by which, 
having nothing, we became possessors of all things. There is our joy 
when first we knew the Lord: let us revive it. We have our old remembrances 
of the promises. How faithful has God been! In sickness, how softly 
did he make our bed! In deep waters, how placidly did he buoy us up! 
In the flaming furnace, how graciously did he deliver us. Old fruits, 
indeed! We have many of them, for his mercies have been more than 
the hairs of our head. Old sins we must regret, but then we have had 
repentances which he has given us, by which we have wept our way to 
the cross, and learned the merit of his blood. We have fruits, this 
morning, both new and old; but here is the point—<i>they are all laid up for Jesus</i>. Truly, those are the best and most acceptable services in which 
Jesus is the solitary aim of the soul, and his glory, without any 
admixture whatever, the end of all our efforts. Let our many fruits 
be laid up only for our Beloved; let us display them when he is with 
us, and not hold them up before the gaze of men. Jesus, we will turn 
the key in our garden door, and none shall enter to rob thee of one 
good fruit from the soil which thou hast watered with thy bloody sweat. 
Our all shall be thine, thine only, O Jesus, our Beloved!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1001pm-p3">Bounteous is Jehovah in his nature; to give is his delight. His gifts 
are beyond measure precious, and are as freely given as the light 
of the sun. He gives grace to his elect because he wills it, to his 
redeemed because of his covenant, to the called because of his promise, 
to believers because they seek it, to sinners because they need it. 
He gives grace abundantly, seasonably, constantly, readily, sovereignly; 
doubly enhancing the value of the boon by the manner of its bestowal. 
Grace in all its forms he freely renders to his people: comforting, 
preserving, sanctifying, directing, instructing, assisting grace, 
he generously pours into their souls without ceasing, and he always 
will do so, whatever may occur. Sickness may befall, but the Lord 
will give grace; poverty may happen to us, but grace will surely be 
afforded; death must come but grace will light a candle at the darkest 
hour. Reader, how blessed it is as years roll round, and the leaves 
begin again to fall, to enjoy such an unfading promise as this, “The Lord will give grace.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1001pm-p4">The little conjunction “<i>and</i>” in this verse is a diamond rivet binding the present with the future: 
grace and glory always go together. God has married them, and none 
can divorce them. The Lord will never deny a soul glory to whom he 
has freely given to live upon his grace; indeed, glory is nothing 
more than grace in its Sabbath dress, grace in full bloom, grace like 
autumn fruit, mellow and perfected. How soon we may have glory none 
can tell! It may be before this month of October has run out we shall 
see the Holy City; but be the interval longer or shorter, we shall 
be glorified ere long. Glory, the glory of heaven, the glory of eternity, 
the glory of Jesus, the glory of the Father, the Lord will surely 
give to his chosen. Oh, rare promise of a faithful God!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1002am-p3">Our hope in Christ for the future is the mainspring and the mainstay 
of our joy here. It will animate our hearts to think often of heaven, 
for all that we can desire is promised there. Here we are weary and 
toilworn, but yonder is the land of <i>rest</i> where the sweat of labour shall no more bedew the worker’s brow, and fatigue shall be forever banished. To those who are weary 
and spent, the word “rest” is full of heaven. We are always in the field of battle; we are so 
tempted within, and so molested by foes without, that we have little 
or no peace; but in heaven we shall enjoy the <i>victory</i>, when the banner shall be waved aloft in triumph, and the sword shall 
be sheathed, and we shall hear our Captain say, “Well done, good and faithful servant.” We have suffered bereavement after bereavement, but we are going 
to the land of the <i>immortal</i> where graves are unknown things. Here sin is a constant grief to 
us, but there we shall be perfectly <i>holy</i>, for there shall by no means enter into that kingdom anything which 
defileth. Hemlock springs not up in the furrows of celestial fields. 
Oh! is it not joy, that you are not to be in banishment forever, that 
you are not to dwell eternally in this wilderness, but shall soon 
inherit Canaan? Nevertheless let it never be said of us, that we are 
dreaming about the <i>future</i> and forgetting the <i>present</i>, let the future sanctify the present to highest uses. Through the 
Spirit of God the hope of heaven is the most potent force for the 
product of virtue; it is a fountain of joyous effort, it is the corner 
stone of cheerful holiness. The man who has this hope in him goes 
about his work with vigour, for the joy of the Lord is his strength. 
He fights against temptation with ardour, for the hope of the next 
world repels the fiery darts of the adversary. He can labour without 
present reward, for he looks for a reward in the world to come.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1002pm-p3">Child of God, do you hesitate to appropriate this title? Ah! has your 
unbelief made you forget that you are greatly beloved too? Must you 
not have been greatly beloved, to have been bought with the precious 
blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot? When 
God smote his only begotten Son for you, what was this but being greatly 
beloved? You lived in sin, and rioted in it, must you not have been 
greatly beloved for God to have borne so patiently with you? You were 
called by grace and led to a Saviour, and made a child of God and 
an heir of heaven. All this proves, does it not, a very great and 
superabounding love? Since that time, whether your path has been rough 
with troubles, or smooth with mercies, it has been full of proofs 
that you are a man greatly beloved. If the Lord has chastened you, 
yet not in anger; if he has made you poor, yet in grace you have been 
rich. The more unworthy you feel yourself to be, the more evidence 
have you that nothing but unspeakable love could have led the Lord 
Jesus to save such a soul as yours. The more demerit you feel, the 
clearer is the display of the abounding love of God in having chosen 
you, and called you, and made you an heir of bliss. Now, if there 
be such love between God and us let us live in the influence and sweetness 
of it, and use the privilege of our position. Do not let us approach 
our Lord as though we were strangers, or as though he were unwilling 
to hear us—for we are greatly beloved by our loving Father. “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how 
shall he not with him also freely give us all things?” Come boldly, O believer, for despite the whisperings of Satan and 
the doubtings of thine own heart, thou art greatly beloved. Meditate 
on the exceeding greatness and faithfulness of divine love this evening, 
and so go to thy bed in peace.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1003am-p3">Angels are the unseen attendants of the saints of God; they bear us 
up in their hands, lest we dash our foot against a stone. Loyalty 
to their Lord leads them to take a deep interest in the children of 
his love; they rejoice over the return of the prodigal to his father’s house below, and they welcome the advent of the believer to the 
King’s palace above. In olden times the sons of God were favoured with 
their visible appearance, and at this day, although unseen by us, 
heaven is still opened, and the angels of God ascend and descend upon 
the Son of man, that they may visit the heirs of salvation. Seraphim

men greatly beloved. If our eyes could be opened, we should see horses

<p class="normal" id="d1003pm-p3">It is a common-place thought, and yet it tastes like nectar to the 
weary heart—Jesus was tempted as I am. You have heard that truth many times: have 
you grasped it? He was tempted to the very same sins into which we 
fall. Do not dissociate Jesus from our common manhood. It is a dark 
room which you are going through, but Jesus went through it before. 
It is a sharp fight which you are waging, but Jesus has stood foot 
to foot with the same enemy. Let us be of good cheer, Christ has borne 
the load before us, and the blood-stained footsteps of the King of 
glory may be seen along the road which we traverse at this hour. There 
is something sweeter yet—Jesus was tempted, but Jesus never sinned. Then, my soul, it is not 
needful for thee to sin, for Jesus was a man, and if one man endured 
these temptations and sinned not, then in his power his members may 
also cease from sin. Some beginners in the divine life think that 
they cannot be tempted without sinning, but they mistake; there is 
no sin in <i>being tempted</i>, but there <i>is</i> sin in <i>yielding to</i> <i>temptation</i>. Herein is comfort for the sorely tempted ones. There is still more 
to encourage them if they reflect that the Lord Jesus, though tempted, 
gloriously triumphed, and as he overcame, so surely shall his followers 
also, for Jesus is the representative man for his people; the Head 
has triumphed, and the members share in the victory. Fears are needless, 
for Christ is with us, armed for our defence. Our place of safety 
is the bosom of the Saviour. Perhaps we are tempted just now, in order 
to drive us nearer to him. Blessed be any wind that blows us into 
the port of our Saviour’s love! Happy wounds, which make us seek the beloved Physician. Ye 
tempted ones, come to your tempted Saviour, for he can be touched 
with a feeling of your infirmities, and will succour every tried and 
tempted one.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1004am-p3">Oftentimes we look forward with forebodings to <i>the time of</i> <i>old age</i>, forgetful that at eventide it shall be light. To many saints, old 
age is the choicest season in their lives. A balmier air fans the 
mariner’s cheek as he nears the shore of immortality, fewer waves ruffle his 
sea, quiet reigns, deep, still and solemn. From the altar of age the 
flashes of the fire of youth are gone, but the more real flame of 
earnest feeling remains. The pilgrims have reached the land Beulah, 
that happy country, whose days are as the days of heaven upon earth. 
Angels visit it, celestial gales blow over it, flowers of paradise 
grow in it, and the air is filled with seraphic music. Some dwell 
here for years, and others come to it but a few hours before their 
departure, but it is an Eden on earth. We may well long for the time 
when we shall recline in its shady groves and be satisfied with hope 
until the time of fruition comes. The setting sun seems larger than 
when aloft in the sky, and a splendour of glory tinges all the clouds 
which surround his going down. Pain breaks not the calm of the sweet 
twilight of age, for strength made perfect in weakness bears up with 
patience under it all. Ripe fruits of choice experience are gathered 
as the rare repast of life’s evening, and the soul prepares itself for rest.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1004am-p4">The Lord’s people shall also enjoy light in <i>the hour of</i> <i>death</i>. Unbelief laments; the shadows fall, the night is coming, existence 
is ending. Ah no, crieth faith, the night is far spent, the true day 
is at hand. Light is come, the light of immortality, the light of 
a Father’s countenance. Gather up thy feet in the bed, see the waiting bands 
of spirits! Angels waft thee away. Farewell, beloved one, thou art 
gone, thou wavest thine hand. Ah, now it is light. The pearly gates 
are open, the golden streets shine in the jasper light. We cover our 
eyes, but thou beholdest the unseen; adieu, brother, thou hast light 
at even-tide, such as we have not yet.</p>

be allowed to commit, cannot destroy his interest in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, as his advocate. The name here given to our Lord is suggestive. 
“<i>Jesus</i>.” Ah! then he is an advocate such as we need, for Jesus is the name 
of one whose business and delight it is to save. “They shall call his name Jesus, for <i>he</i> <i>shall save</i> his people from their sins.” His sweetest name implies his success. Next, it is “Jesus <i>Christ</i>”—Christos, the anointed. This shows <i>his authority</i> to plead. The Christ has a right to plead, for he is the Father’s own appointed advocate and elected priest. If he were of our choosing 
he might fail, but if God hath laid help upon one that is mighty, 
we may safely lay our trouble where God has laid his help. He is Christ, 
and therefore authorized; he is Christ, and therefore <i>qualified</i>, for the anointing has fully fitted him for his work. He can plead 
so as to move the heart of God and prevail. What words of tenderness, 
what sentences of persuasion will the anointed use when he stands 
up to plead for me! One more letter of his name remains, “Jesus Christ <i>the righteous</i>.” This is not only his character <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1004pm-p3.1">but</span>  his plea. It is his character, and if the Righteous One be my advocate, 
then my cause is good, or he would not have espoused it. It is his 
plea, for he meets the charge of unrighteousness against me by the 
plea that <i>he</i> is righteous. He declares himself my substitute and puts his obedience 
to my account. My soul, thou hast a friend well fitted to be thine 
advocate, he cannot but succeed; leave thyself entirely in his hands.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1005am-p3">All the strength supplied to us by our gracious God is meant for service, 
not for wantonness or boasting. When the prophet Elijah found the 
cake baked on the coals, and the cruse of water placed at his head, 
as he lay under the juniper tree, he was no gentleman to be gratified 
with dainty fare that he might stretch himself at his ease; far otherwise, 
he was commissioned to go forty days and forty nights in the strength 
of it, journeying towards Horeb, the mount of God. When the Master 
invited the disciples to “Come and dine” with him, after the feast was concluded he said to Peter, “Feed my sheep”; further adding, “Follow me.” Even thus it is with us; we eat the bread of heaven, that we may 
expend our strength in the Master’s service. We come to the passover, and eat of the paschal lamb with 
loins girt, and staff in hand, so as to start off at once when we 
have satisfied our hunger. Some Christians are for living on Christ, 
but are not so anxious to live <i>for</i> Christ. Earth should be a preparation for heaven; and heaven is the 
place where saints feast most and work most. They sit down at the 
table of our Lord, and they serve him day and night in his temple. 
They eat of heavenly food and render perfect service. Believer, in 
the strength you daily gain from Christ labour for him. Some of us 
have yet to learn much concerning the design of our Lord in giving 
us his grace. We are not to retain the precious grains of truth as 
the Egyptian mummy held the wheat for ages, without giving it an opportunity 
to grow: we must sow it and water it. Why does the Lord send down 
the rain upon the thirsty earth, and give the genial sunshine? Is 
it not that these may all help the fruits of the earth to yield food 
for man? Even so the Lord feeds and refreshes our souls that we may 
afterwards use our renewed strength in the promotion of his glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1005pm-p3">Mr. MacDonald asked the inhabitants of the island of St. Kilda how 
a man must be saved. An old man replied, “We shall be saved if we repent, and forsake our sins, and turn to 
God.” “Yes,” said a middle-aged female, “and with a true heart too.” “Aye,” rejoined a third, “and with prayer”; and, added a fourth, “It must be the prayer of the heart.” “And we must be diligent too,” said a fifth, “in keeping the commandments.” Thus, each having contributed his mite, feeling that a very decent 
creed had been made up, they all looked and listened for the preacher’s approbation, but they had aroused his deepest pity. The carnal mind 
always maps out for itself a way in which self can work and become 
great, but the Lord’s way is quite the reverse. Believing and being baptized are no matters 
of merit to be gloried in—they are so simple that boasting is excluded, and free grace bears 
the palm. It may be that the reader is unsaved—what is the reason? Do you think the way of salvation as laid down 
in the text to be dubious? How can that be when God has pledged his 
own word for its certainty? Do you think it too easy? Why, then, do 
you not attend to it? Its ease leaves those without excuse who neglect 
it. To believe is simply to trust, to depend, to rely upon Christ 
Jesus. To be baptized is to submit to the ordinance which our Lord 
fulfilled at Jordan, to which the converted ones submitted at Pentecost, 
to which the jailer yielded obedience the very night of his conversion. 
The outward sign saves not, but it sets forth to us our death, burial, 
and resurrection with Jesus, and, like the Lord’s Supper, is not to be neglected. Reader, do you believe in Jesus? 
Then, dear friend, dismiss your fears, you shall be saved. Are you 
still an unbeliever, then remember there is but one door, and if you 
will not enter by it you will perish in your sins.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1006am-p3">He who is a believer in Jesus finds enough in his Lord to satisfy 
him now, and to content him for evermore. The believer is not the 
man whose days are weary for want of comfort, and whose nights are 
long from absence of heart-cheering thought, for he finds in religion 
such a spring of joy, such a fountain of consolation, that he is content 
and happy. Put him in a dungeon and he will find good company; place 
him in a barren wilderness, he will eat the bread of heaven; drive 
him away from friendship, he will meet the “friend that sticketh closer than a brother.” Blast all his gourds, and he will find shadow beneath the Rock of 
Ages; sap the foundation of his earthly hopes, but his heart will 
still be fixed, trusting in the Lord. The heart is as insatiable as 
the grave till Jesus enters it, and then it is a cup full to overflowing. 
There is such a fulness in Christ that he alone is the believer’s all. The true saint is so completely satisfied with the all-sufficiency 
of Jesus that he thirsts no more—except it be for deeper draughts of the living fountain. In that sweet 
manner, believer, shalt thou thirst; it shall not be a thirst of pain, 
but of loving desire; thou wilt find it a sweet thing to be panting 
after a fuller enjoyment of Jesus’ love. One in days of yore said, “I have been sinking my bucket down into the well full often, but now 
my thirst after Jesus has become so insatiable, that I long to put 
the well itself to my lips, and drink right on.” Is this the feeling of thine heart now, believer? Dost thou feel 
that all thy desires are satisfied in Jesus, and that thou hast no 
want now, but to know more of him, and to have closer fellowship with 
him? Then come continually to the fountain, and take of the water 
of life freely. Jesus will never think you take too much, but will 
ever welcome you, saying, “Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1006pm-p3">Strange choice of Moses, but how much more strange the choice of him 
who is a prophet like unto Moses, and greater than he! Our Lord, who 
is fair as the lily, has entered into marriage union with one who 
confesses herself to be black, because the sun has looked upon her. 
It is the wonder of angels that the love of Jesus should be set upon 
poor, lost, guilty men. Each believer must, when filled with a sense 
of Jesus’ love, be also overwhelmed with astonishment that such love should 
be lavished on an object so utterly unworthy of it. Knowing as we 
do our secret guiltiness, unfaithfulness, and black-heartedness, we 
are dissolved in grateful admiration of the matchless freeness and 
sovereignty of grace. Jesus must have found the cause of his love 
in his own heart, he could not have found it in us, for it is not 
there. Even since our conversion we have been black, though grace 
has made us comely. Holy Rutherford said of himself what we must each 
subscribe to—“His relation to me is, that I am sick, and he is the Physician of 
whom I stand in need. Alas! how often I play fast and loose with Christ! 
He bindeth, I loose; he buildeth, I cast down; I quarrel with Christ, 
and he agreeth with me twenty times a day!” Most tender and faithful Husband of our souls, pursue thy gracious 
work of conforming us to thine image, till thou shalt present even 
us poor Ethiopians unto thyself, without spot, or wrinkle, or any 
such thing. Moses met with opposition because of his marriage, and 
both himself and his spouse were the subjects of an evil eye. Can 
we wonder if this vain world opposes Jesus and his spouse, and especially 
when great sinners are converted? for this is ever the Pharisee’s ground of objection, “This man receiveth sinners.” Still is the old cause of quarrel revived, “Because he had married an Ethiopian woman.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1007am-p3">Our heavenly Father sends us frequent troubles <i>to try our</i> <i>faith</i>. If our faith be worth anything, it will stand the test. Gilt is 
afraid of fire, but gold is not: the <i>paste</i> gem dreads to be touched by the diamond, but the true jewel fears 
no test. It is a poor faith which can only trust God when friends 
are true, the body full of health, and the business profitable; but 
that is true faith which holds by the Lord’s faithfulness when friends are gone, when the body is sick, when 
spirits are depressed, and the light of our Father’s countenance is hidden. A faith which can say, in the direst trouble, 
“Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him,” is heaven-born faith. The Lord afflicts his servants <i>to glorify himself</i>, for he is greatly glorified in the graces of his people, which are 
his own handiwork. When “tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, 
hope,” the Lord is honoured by these growing virtues. We should never know 
the music of the harp if the strings were left untouched; nor enjoy 
the juice of the grape if it were not trodden in the winepress; nor 
discover the sweet perfume of cinnamon if it were not pressed and 
beaten; nor feel the warmth of fire if the coals were not utterly 
consumed. The wisdom and power of the great Workman are discovered 
by the trials through which his vessels of mercy are permitted to 
pass. Present afflictions <i>tend also</i> <i>to heighten future joy</i>. There must be shades in the picture to bring out the beauty of the 
lights. Could we be so supremely blessed in heaven, if we had not 
known the curse of sin and the sorrow of earth? Will not peace be 
sweeter after conflict, and rest more welcome after toil? Will not 
the recollection of past sufferings enhance the bliss of the glorified? 
There are many other comfortable answers to the question with which 
we opened our brief meditation, let us muse upon it all day long.</p>

Listen to the Christian’s answer, and see if it is yours. “On whom dost thou trust?” “I trust,” says the Christian, “in a triune God. I trust <i>the Father</i>, believing that he has chosen me from before the foundations of the 
world; I trust him to provide for me in providence, to teach me, to 
guide me, to correct me if need be, and to bring me home to his own 
house where the many mansions are. I trust <i>the Son</i>. Very God of very God is he—the man Christ Jesus. I trust in him to take away all my sins by his 
own sacrifice, and to adorn me with his perfect righteousness. I trust 
him to be my Intercessor, to present my prayers and desires before 
his Father’s throne, and I trust him to be my Advocate at the last great day, 
to plead my cause, and to justify me. I trust him for what he is, 
for what he has done, and for what he has promised yet to do. And 
I trust <i>the Holy</i> <i>Spirit</i>—he has begun to save me from my inbred sins; I trust him to drive 
them all out; I trust him to curb my temper, to subdue my will, to 
enlighten my understanding, to check my passions, to comfort my despondency, 
to help my weakness, to illuminate my darkness; I trust him to dwell 
in me as my life, to reign in me as my King, to sanctify me wholly, 
spirit, soul, and body, and then to take me up to dwell with the saints 
in light forever.”</p>

thou, reader, if this trust is thine! So trusting, thou shalt enjoy

<p class="normal" id="d1008am-p3">We learn from this narrative, <i>the necessity of human</i> <i>agency</i>. The draught of fishes was miraculous, yet neither the fisherman 
nor his boat, nor his fishing tackle were ignored; but all were used 
to take the fishes. So in the saving of souls, God worketh by means; 
and while the present economy of grace shall stand, God will be pleased 
by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. When God 
worketh without instruments, doubtless he is glorified; but he hath 
himself selected the plan of instrumentality as being that by which 
he is most magnified in the earth. <i>Means of themselves are utterly unavailing</i>. “Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing.” What was the reason of this? Were they not fishermen plying their 
special calling? Verily, they were no raw hands; they understood the 
work. Had they gone about the toil unskilfully? No. Had they lacked 
industry? No, they had toiled. Had they lacked perseverance? No, they 
had <i>toiled all the night</i>. Was there a deficiency of fish in the sea? Certainly not, for as 
soon as the Master came, they swam to the net in shoals. What, then, 
is the reason? Is it because there is no power in the means of themselves 
apart from the presence of Jesus? “Without him we can do nothing.” But with Christ we can do all things. <i>Christ’s presence confers success</i>. Jesus sat in Peter’s boat, and his will, by a mysterious influence, drew the fish to 
the net. When Jesus is lifted up in his Church, his presence is the 
Church’s power—the shout of a king is in the midst of her. “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.” Let us go out this morning on our work of soul fishing, looking up 
in faith, and around us in solemn anxiety. Let us toil till night 
comes, and we shall not labour in vain, for he who bids us let down 
the net, will fill it with fishes.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1008pm-p3">Mark the grand characteristic of true prayer—“<i>In the Holy</i> <i>Ghost</i>.” The seed of acceptable devotion must come from heaven’s storehouse. Only the prayer which comes from God can go to God. 
We must shoot the Lord’s arrows back to him. That desire which he writes upon our heart will 
move his heart and bring down a blessing, but the desires of the flesh 
have no power with him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1008pm-p4">Praying in the Holy Ghost is praying in <i>fervency</i>. Cold prayers ask the Lord not to hear them. Those who do not plead 
with fervency, plead not at all. As well speak of lukewarm fire as 
of lukewarm prayer—it is essential that it be red hot. It is praying <i>perseveringly</i>. The true suppliant gathers force as he proceeds, and grows more 
fervent when God delays to answer. The longer the gate is closed, 
the more vehemently does he use the knocker, and the longer the angel 
lingers the more resolved is he that he will never let him go without 
the blessing. Beautiful in God’s sight is tearful, agonizing, unconquerable importunity. It means 
praying <i>humbly</i>, for the Holy Spirit never puffs us up with pride. It is his office 
to convince of sin, and so to bow us down in contrition and brokenness 
of spirit. We shall never sing <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> except we pray to God <i>De profundis</i>: out of the depths must we cry, or we shall never behold glory in 
the highest. It is <i>loving</i> prayer. Prayer should be perfumed with love, saturated with love—love to our fellow saints, and love to Christ. Moreover, it must be 
a prayer full of <i>faith</i>. A man prevails only as he believes. The Holy Spirit is the author 
of faith, and strengthens it, so that we pray believing God’s promise. O that this blessed combination of excellent graces, priceless 
and sweet as the spices of the merchant, might be fragrant within 
us because the Holy Ghost is in our hearts! Most blessed Comforter, 
exert thy mighty power within us, helping our infirmities in prayer.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1009am-p3">In some sense the path to heaven is very safe, but in other respects 
there is <i>no road so dangerous</i>. It is beset with difficulties. One false step (and how easy it is 
to take that if grace be absent), and down we go. What a slippery 
path is that which some of us have to tread! How many times have we 
to exclaim with the Psalmist, “My feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped.” If we were strong, sure-footed mountaineers, this would not matter 
so much; but in ourselves, <i>how weak we are</i>! In the best roads <i>we soon falter</i>, in the smoothest paths we quickly stumble. These feeble knees of 
ours can scarcely support our tottering weight. A straw may throw 
us, and a pebble can wound us; we are mere children tremblingly taking 
our first steps in the walk of faith, our heavenly Father holds us 
by the arms or we should soon be down. Oh, if we are kept from falling, 
how must we bless the patient power which watches over us day by day! 
Think, how prone we are to sin, how apt to choose danger, how strong 
our tendency to cast ourselves down, and these reflections will make 
us sing more sweetly than we have ever done, “Glory be to him, who is able to keep us from falling.” <i>We have many foes</i> who try to push us down. The road is rough and we are weak, but in 
addition to this, enemies lurk in ambush, who rush out when we least 
expect them, and labour to trip us up, or hurl us down the nearest precipice. Only an Almighty arm can preserve us from 
these unseen foes, who are seeking to destroy us. Such an arm is engaged 
for our defence. He is faithful that hath promised, and he is able 
to keep us from falling, so that with a deep sense of our utter weakness, 
we may cherish a firm belief in our perfect safety, and say, with 
joyful confidence,</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1009pm-p3">Genuine seekers who as yet have not obtained the blessing, may take 
comfort from the story before us. The Saviour did not at once bestow 
the blessing, even though the woman had great faith in him. He intended 
to give it, but he waited awhile. “He answered her not a word.” Were not her prayers good? Never better in the world. Was not her 
case needy? Sorrowfully needy. Did she not <i>feel</i> her need sufficiently? She felt it overwhelmingly. Was she not earnest 
enough? She was intensely so. Had she no faith? She had such a high 
degree of it that even Jesus wondered, and said, “O woman, great is thy faith.” See then, although it is true that faith brings peace, yet it does 
not always bring it instantaneously. There may be certain reasons 
calling for the trial of faith, rather than the reward of faith. Genuine 
faith may be in the soul like a hidden seed, but as yet it may not 
have budded and blossomed into joy and peace. A painful silence from 
the Saviour is the grievous trial of many a seeking soul, but heavier 
still is the affliction of a harsh cutting reply such as this, “It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.” Many in waiting upon the Lord find immediate delight, but this is 
not the case with all. Some, like the jailer, are in a moment turned 
from darkness to light, but others are plants of slower growth. A 
deeper sense of sin may be given to you instead of a sense of pardon, 
and in such a case you will have need of patience to bear the heavy 
blow. Ah! poor heart, though Christ beat and bruise thee, or even 
slay thee, trust him; though he should give thee an angry word, believe 
in the love of his heart. Do not, I beseech thee, give up seeking 
or trusting my Master, because thou hast not yet obtained the conscious 
joy which thou longest for. Cast thyself on him, and perseveringly 
depend even where thou canst not rejoicingly hope.</p>

make us faultless? He will wash us from our sins in his own blood 
until we are white and fair as God’s purest angel; and we shall be clothed in his righteousness, that 
righteousness which makes the saint who wears it positively faultless; 
yea, perfect in the sight of God. We shall be unblameable and unreproveable 
even in his eyes. His law will not only have no charge against us, 
but it will be magnified in us. Moreover, the work of the Holy Spirit 
within us will be altogether complete. He will make us so perfectly 
holy, that we shall have no lingering tendency to sin. Judgment, memory, 
will—every power and passion shall be emancipated from the thraldom of 
evil. We shall be holy even as God is holy, and in his presence we 
shall dwell forever. Saints will not be out of place in heaven, their 
beauty will be as great as that of the place prepared for them. Oh 
the rapture of that hour when the everlasting doors shall be lifted 
up, and we, being made meet for the inheritance, shall dwell with 
the saints in light. Sin gone, Satan shut out, temptation past forever, 
and ourselves “faultless” before God, this will be heaven indeed! Let us be joyful now as we

shall do it, that he may have the glory. Here is not a word said of 
any effort of our own which may be needed to assist the Lord. Neither 
our strength nor our weakness is taken into the account, but the lone 
<i>I</i>, like the sun in the heavens, shines out resplendent in all-sufficience. 
Why then do we calculate our forces, and consult with flesh and blood 
to our grievous wounding? Jehovah has power enough without borrowing 
from our puny arm. Peace, ye unbelieving thoughts, be still, and know 
that the Lord reigneth. Nor is there a hint concerning secondary means 
and causes. The Lord says nothing of friends and helpers: he undertakes 
the work alone, and feels no need of human arms to aid him. Vain are 
all our lookings around to companions and relatives; they are broken 
reeds if we lean upon them—often unwilling when able, and unable when they are willing. Since 
the promise comes alone from God, it would be well to wait only upon 
him; and when we do so, our expectation never fails us. Who are the 
wicked that we should fear them? The Lord will utterly consume them; 
they are to be pitied rather than feared. As for terrible ones, they 
are only terrors to those who have no God to fly to, for when the 
Lord is on our side, whom shall we fear? If we run into sin to please 
the wicked, we have cause to be alarmed, but if we hold fast our integrity, 
the rage of tyrants shall be overruled for our good. When the fish 
swallowed Jonah, he found him a morsel which he could not digest; 
and when the world devours the church, it is glad to be rid of it 
again. In all times of fiery trial, in patience let us possess our 
souls.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1011am-p3">The act of prayer <i>teaches us our unworthiness</i>, which is a very salutary lesson for such proud beings as we are. 
If God gave us favours without constraining us to pray for them we 
should never know how poor we are, but a true prayer is an inventory 
of wants, a catalogue of necessities, a revelation of hidden poverty. 
While it is an application to divine wealth, it is a confession of 
human emptiness. The most healthy state of a Christian is to be always 
empty in self and constantly depending upon the Lord for supplies; 
to be always poor in self and rich in Jesus; weak as water personally, 
but mighty through God to do great exploits; and hence the use of 
prayer, because, while it adores God, it lays the creature where it 
should be, in the very dust. Prayer is in itself, apart from the answer 
which it brings, a great benefit to the Christian. As the runner gains 
strength for the race by daily exercise, so for the great race of 
life we acquire energy by the hallowed labour of prayer. Prayer plumes 
the wings of God’s young eaglets, that they may learn to mount above the clouds. Prayer 
girds the loins of God’s warriors, and sends them forth to combat with their sinews braced 
and their muscles firm. An earnest pleader cometh out of his closet, 
even as the sun ariseth from the chambers of the east, rejoicing like 
a strong man to run his race. Prayer is that uplifted hand of Moses 
which routs the Amalekites more than the sword of Joshua; it is the 
arrow shot from the chamber of the prophet foreboding defeat to the 
Syrians. Prayer girds human weakness with divine strength, turns human 
folly into heavenly wisdom, and gives to troubled mortals the peace 
of God. We know not what prayer cannot do! We thank thee, great God, 
for the mercy-seat, a choice proof of thy marvellous lovingkindness. 
Help us to use it aright throughout this day!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1011pm-p3">In the second epistle to Timothy, first chapter, and ninth verse, 
are these words—“Who hath saved us, and called us with an <i>holy</i> calling.” Now, here is a touchstone by which we may try our calling. It is 
“an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his 
own purpose and grace.” This calling forbids all trust in our own doings, and conducts us 
to Christ alone for salvation, but it afterwards purges us from dead 
works to serve the living and true God. As he that hath called you 
is holy, so must you be holy. If you are living in sin, you are not 
called, but if you are truly Christ's, you can say, “Nothing pains me so much as sin; I desire to be rid of it; Lord, help 
me to be holy.” Is this the panting of thy heart? Is this the tenor of thy life towards 
God, and his divine will? Again, in <scripRef passage="Php 3:13, 14" id="d1011pm-p3.1" parsed="|Phil|3|13|3|14" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.13-Phil.3.14">Philippians, 3:13, 14</scripRef>, we are told of “The <i>high</i> calling of God in Christ Jesus.” Is then your calling a high calling? Has it ennobled your heart, 
and set it upon heavenly things? Has it elevated your hopes, your 
tastes, your desires? Has it upraised the constant tenor of your life, 
so that you spend it with God and for God? Another test we find in 
<scripRef passage="Heb 3:1" id="d1011pm-p3.2" parsed="|Heb|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.3.1">Hebrews 3:1</scripRef>—“Partakers of the <i>heavenly</i> calling.” Heavenly calling means a call <i>from</i> heaven. If man alone call thee, thou art uncalled. Is thy calling 
of God? Is it a call <i>to</i> heaven as well as from heaven? Unless thou art a stranger here, and 
heaven thy home, thou hast not been called with a heavenly calling; 
for those who have been so called, declare that they look for a city 
which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God, and they themselves 
are strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. Is thy calling thus holy, 
high, heavenly? Then, beloved, thou hast been called of God, for such 
is the calling wherewith God doth call his people.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1012am-p3">There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence 
is wiser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more 
alone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on his Word 
spiritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to <i>muse upon the things of God, because we</i> <i>thus get the real nutriment out of them</i>. Truth is something like the cluster of the vine: if we would have 
wine from it, we must bruise it; we must press and squeeze it many 
times. The bruiser’s feet must come down joyfully upon the bunches, or else the juice 
will not flow; and they must well tread the grapes, or else much of 
the precious liquid will be wasted. So we must, by meditation, tread 
the clusters of truth, if we would get the wine of consolation therefrom. 
Our bodies are not supported by merely taking food into the mouth, 
but the process which really supplies the muscle, and the nerve, and 
the sinew, and the bone, is the process of digestion. It is by digestion 
that the outward food becomes assimilated with the inner life. Our 
souls are not nourished merely by listening awhile to this, and then 
to that, and then to the other part of divine truth. Hearing, reading, 
marking, and learning, all require inwardly digesting to complete 
their usefulness, and the inward digesting of the truth lies for the 
most part in meditating upon it. Why is it that some Christians, although 
they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in the divine life? 
Because they neglect their closets, and do not thoughtfully meditate 
on God’s Word. They love the wheat, but they do not grind it; they would 
have the corn, but they will not go forth into the fields to gather 
it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it; the 
water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. From 
such folly deliver us, O Lord, and be this our resolve this morning, 
<i>“I will meditate in thy precepts.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d1012pm-p3">This age is peculiarly the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, in which 
Jesus cheers us, not by his personal presence, as he shall do by-and-by, 
but by the indwelling and constant abiding of the Holy Ghost, who 
is evermore the Comforter of the church. It is his office to console 
the hearts of God’s people. He convinces of sin; he illuminates and instructs; but still 
the main part of his work lies in making glad the hearts of the renewed, 
in confirming the weak, and lifting up all those that be bowed down. 
He does this by revealing Jesus to them. The Holy Spirit consoles, 
but Christ <i>is the consolation</i>. If we may use the figure, the Holy Spirit is the Physician, but 
Jesus is the medicine. <i>He</i> heals the wound, but it is by applying the holy ointment of Christ’s name and grace. He takes not of his own things, but of the things 
of Christ. So if we give to the Holy Spirit the Greek name of <i>Paraclete</i>, as we sometimes do, then our heart confers on our blessed Lord Jesus 
the title of <i>Paraclesis</i>. If the one be the Comforter, the other is the Comfort. Now, with 
such rich provision for his need, why should the Christian be sad 
and desponding? The Holy Spirit has graciously engaged to be thy Comforter: 
dost thou imagine, O thou weak and trembling believer, that he will 
be negligent of his sacred trust? Canst thou suppose that he has undertaken 
what he cannot or will not perform? If it be his especial work to 
strengthen thee, and to comfort thee, dost thou suppose he has forgotten 
his business, or that he will fail in the loving office which he sustains 
towards thee? Nay, think not so hardly of the tender and blessed Spirit 
whose name is “the Comforter.” He delights to give the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment 
of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Trust thou in him, and he will 
surely comfort thee till the house of mourning is closed forever, 
and the marriage feast has begun.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1013am-p3">Genuine, spiritual mourning for sin is <i>the work of the</i> <i>Spirit of God</i>. Repentance is too choice a flower to grow in nature’s garden. Pearls grow naturally in oysters, but penitence never shows 
itself in sinners except divine grace works it in them. If thou hast 
one particle of real hatred for sin, God must have given it thee, 
for human nature’s thorns never produced a single fig. “That which is born of the flesh is flesh.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1013am-p4">True repentance <i>has a distinct reference to the Saviour</i>. When we repent of sin, we must have one eye upon sin and another 
upon the cross, or it will be better still if we fix both our eyes 
upon Christ and see our transgressions only, in the light of his love.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1013am-p5">True sorrow for sin is <i>eminently practical</i>. No man may say he hates sin, if he lives in it. Repentance makes 
us see the evil of sin, not merely as a theory, but experimentally—as a burnt child dreads fire. We shall be as much afraid of it, as 
a man who has lately been stopped and robbed is afraid of the thief 
upon the highway; and we shall shun it—shun it in everything—not in great things only, but in little things, as men shun little 
vipers as well as great snakes. True mourning for sin will make us 
very jealous over our tongue, lest it should say a wrong word; we 
shall be very watchful over our daily actions, lest in anything we 
offend, and each night we shall close the day with painful confessions 
of shortcoming, and each morning awaken with anxious prayers, that 
this day God would hold us up that we may not sin against him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1013am-p6">Sincere repentance is <i>continual</i>. Believers repent until their dying day. This dropping well is not 
intermittent. Every other sorrow yields to time, but this dear sorrow 
grows with our growth, and it is so sweet a bitter, that we thank 
God we are permitted to enjoy and to suffer it until we enter our 
eternal rest.</p>

my Lord? I do love him, and perhaps by his grace, I could even die 
for him, but as for my love in itself, it can scarcely endure a scoffing 
jest, much less a cruel death. Surely it is my Beloved’s love which is here spoken of—the love of Jesus, the matchless lover of souls. His love was indeed 
stronger than the most terrible death, for it endured the trial of 
the cross triumphantly. It was a lingering death, but love survived 
the torment; a shameful death, but love despised the shame; a penal 
death, but love bore our iniquities; a forsaken, lonely death, from 
which the eternal Father hid his face, but love endured the curse, 
and gloried over all. Never such love, never such death. It was a 
desperate duel, but love bore the palm. What then, my heart? Hast 
thou no emotions excited within thee at the contemplation of such 
heavenly affection? Yes, my Lord, I long, I pant to feel thy love 
flaming like a furnace within me. Come thou thyself and excite the

and yet out of weakness were made strong. Grace gave them all their 
unflinching constancy—there is the same grace for me. Jesus, lover of my soul, shed abroad 
such love, even thy love in my heart, this evening.</p>

know. The higher I climb the loftier will be the summits which invite 
my eager footsteps. I shall want the more as I get the more. Like 
the miser’s treasure, my gold will make me covet more. To conclude; this knowledge

I enjoy it, make me something more than “Man that is born of woman, who is of few days, and full of trouble”; for it will fling about me the immortality of the ever living Saviour,

world, at any rate it must be so as by fire. Such a bare salvation 
is almost as much to be dreaded as desired. Reader, would you wish 
to leave this world in the darkness of a desponding death bed, and 
enter heaven as a shipwrecked mariner climbs the rocks of his native 
country? then be worldly; be mixed up with Mammonites, and refuse 
to go without the camp bearing Christ’s reproach. But would you have a heaven below as well as a heaven 
above? Would you comprehend with all saints what are the heights and 
depths, and know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge? Would 
you receive an abundant entrance into the joy of your Lord? Then come 
ye out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean 
thing. Would you attain the full assurance of faith? you cannot gain 
it while you commune with sinners. Would you flame with vehement love? 
Your love will be damped by the drenchings of godless society. You 
cannot become a great Christian—you may be a babe in grace, but you never can be a perfect man in 
Christ Jesus while you yield yourself to the worldly maxims and modes 
of business of men of the world. It is ill for an heir of heaven to 
be a great friend with the heirs of hell. It has a bad look when a 
courtier is too intimate with his king’s enemies. Even small inconsistencies are dangerous. Little thorns 
make great blisters, little moths destroy fine garments, and little 
frivolities and little rogueries will rob religion of a thousand joys. 
O professor, too little separated from sinners, you know not what 
you lose by your conformity to the world. It cuts the tendons of your 
strength, and makes you creep where you ought to run. Then, for your 
own comfort’s sake, and for the sake of your growth in grace, if you be a Christian, 
be a Christian, and be a marked and distinct one.</p>

Those who supposed themselves to be waiting for him, showed the fallacy 
of their professions by rejecting him when he came. His life on earth 
was a winnowing fan, which tried the great heap of religious profession, 
and few enough could abide the process. But what will his second advent 
be? What sinner can endure to think of it? “He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath 
of his lips shall he slay the wicked.” When in his humiliation he did but say to the soldiers, “I am he,” they fell backward; what will be the terror of his enemies when he 
shall more fully reveal himself as the “<i>I am</i>?” His death shook earth and darkened heaven, what shall be the dreadful 
splendour of that day in which as the living Saviour, he shall summon 
the quick and dead before him? O that the terrors of the Lord would 
persuade men to forsake their sins and kiss the Son lest he be angry! 
Though a lamb, he is yet the lion of the tribe of Judah, rending the 
prey in pieces; and though he breaks not the bruised reed, yet will 
he break his enemies with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like 
a potter’s vessel. None of his foes shall bear up before the tempest of his 
wrath, or hide themselves from the sweeping hail of his indignation; 
but his beloved blood washed people look for his appearing with joy, 
and hope to abide it without fear: to them he sits as a refiner even 
now, and when he has tried them they shall come forth as gold. Let 
us search ourselves this morning and make our calling and election sure, so that the coming of the Lord may cause no dark forebodings 
in our mind. O for grace to cast away all hypocrisy, and to be found 
of him sincere and without rebuke in the day of his appearing.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1015pm-p3">Every firstborn creature must be the Lord's, but since the ass was 
unclean, it could not be presented in sacrifice. What then? Should 
it be allowed to go free from the universal law? By no means. God 
admits of no exceptions. The ass is his due, but he will not accept 
it; he will not abate the claim, but yet he cannot be pleased with 
the victim. No way of escape remained but redemption—the creature must be saved by the substitution of a lamb in its place; 
or if not redeemed, it must die. My soul, here is a lesson for thee. 
That unclean animal is thyself; thou art justly the property of the 
Lord who made thee and preserves thee, but thou art so sinful that 
God will not, cannot, accept thee; and it has come to this, the Lamb 
of God must stand in thy stead, or thou must die eternally. Let all 
the world know of thy gratitude to that spotless Lamb who has already 
bled for thee, and so redeemed thee from the fatal curse of the law. 
Must it not sometimes have been a question with the Israelite which 
should die, the ass or the lamb? Would not the good man pause to estimate 
and compare? Assuredly there was no comparison between the value of 
the soul of man and the life of the Lord Jesus, and yet the Lamb dies, 
and man the ass is spared. My soul, admire the boundless love of God 
to thee and others of the human race. Worms are bought with the blood 
of the Son of the Highest! Dust and ashes redeemed with a price far 
above silver and gold! What a doom had been mine had not plenteous 
redemption been found! The breaking of the neck of the ass was but 
a momentary penalty, but who shall measure the wrath to come to which 
no limit can be imagined? Inestimably dear is the glorious Lamb who 
has redeemed us from such a doom.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1016am-p3">In these words the believer is invited to a holy nearness to Jesus. 
“Come and dine,” implies the same table, the same meat; aye, and sometimes it means 
to sit side by side, and lean our head upon the Saviour’s bosom. It is being brought into the banqueting-house, where waves 
the banner of redeeming love. “Come and dine,” gives us a vision of <i>union with Jesus</i>, because the only food that we can feast upon when we dine with Jesus 
is <i>himself</i>. Oh, what union is this! It is a depth which reason cannot fathom, 
that we thus feed upon Jesus. “He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and 
I in him.” It is also an invitation to enjoy <i>fellowship with</i> <i>the saints</i>. Christians may differ on a variety of points, but they have all 
one spiritual appetite; and if we cannot all <i>feel</i> alike, we can all <i>feed</i> alike on the bread of life sent down from heaven. At the table of 
fellowship with Jesus we are one bread and one cup. As the loving 
cup goes round we pledge one another heartily therein. Get nearer 
to Jesus, and you will find yourself linked more and more in spirit 
to all who are like yourself, supported by the same heavenly manna. 
If we were more near to Jesus we should be more near to one another. 
We likewise see in these words the <i>source of strength</i> for every Christian. To look at Christ is to live, but for strength 
to serve him you must “come and dine.” We labour under much unnecessary weakness on account of neglecting 
this precept of the Master. We none of us need to put ourselves on 
low diet; on the contrary, we should fatten on the marrow and fatness 
of the gospel that we may accumulate strength therein, and urge every 
power to its full tension in the Master’s service. Thus, then, if you would realize <i>nearness</i> to Jesus, <i>union</i> with Jesus, <i>love</i> to his people and <i>strength from Jesus</i>, “come and dine” with him by faith.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1016pm-p3">There are times in our spiritual experience when human counsel or 
sympathy, or religious ordinances, fail to comfort or help us. Why 
does our gracious God permit this? Perhaps it is because we have been 
living too much without him, and he therefore takes away everything 
upon which we have been in the habit of depending, that he may drive 
us to himself. It is a blessed thing to live at the fountain head. 
While our skin- bottles are full, we are content, like Hagar and Ishmael, 
to go into the wilderness; but when those are dry, nothing will serve 
us but “Thou God seest me.” We are like the prodigal, we love the swine-troughs and forget our 
Father’s house. Remember, we can make swine-troughs and husks even out of 
the forms of religion; they are blessed things, but we may put them 
in God’s place, and then they are of no value. Anything becomes an idol when 
it keeps us away from God: even the brazen serpent is to be despised 
as “Nehushtan,” if we worship it instead of God. The prodigal was never safer than 
when he was driven to his father’s bosom, because he could find sustenance nowhere else. Our Lord favours 
us with a famine in the land that it may make us seek after himself 
the more. The best position for a Christian is living wholly and directly 
on God’s grace—still abiding where he stood at first—“Having nothing, and yet possessing all things.” Let us never for a moment think that our standing is in our sanctification, 
our mortification, our graces, or our feelings, but know that because 
Christ offered a full atonement, therefore we are saved; for we are 
complete in him. Having nothing of our own to trust to, but resting 
upon the merits of Jesus—his passion and holy life furnish us with the only sure ground of 
confidence. Beloved, when we are brought to a thirsting condition, 
we are sure to turn to the fountain of life with eagerness.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1017am-p3">The thought of David’s heart at this time was a <i>false</i> thought, because he certainly had no ground for thinking that God’s anointing him by Samuel was intended to be left as an empty unmeaning 
act. On no one occasion had the Lord deserted his servant; he had 
been placed in perilous positions very often, but not one instance 
had occurred in which divine interposition had not delivered him. 
The trials to which he had been exposed had been varied; they had 
not assumed one form only, but many—yet in every case he who sent the trial had also graciously ordained 
a way of escape. David could not put his finger upon any entry in 
his diary, and say of it, “Here is evidence that the Lord will forsake me,” for the entire tenor of his past life proved the very reverse. He 
should have argued from what God <i>had</i> done for him, that God would be his defender still. But is it not 
just in the same way that <i>we</i> doubt God’s help? Is it not <i>mistrust without a cause</i>? Have we ever had the shadow of a reason to doubt our Father’s goodness? Have not his lovingkindnesses been marvellous? Has he 
<i>once</i> failed to justify our trust? Ah, no! our God has not left us at any 
time. We have had dark nights, but the star of love has shone forth 
amid the blackness; we have been in stern conflicts, but over our 
head he has held aloft the shield of our defence. We have gone through 
many trials, but never to our detriment, always to our advantage; 
and the conclusion from our past experience is, that he who has been 
with us in six troubles, will not forsake us in the seventh. What 
we have known of our faithful God, proves that he will keep us to 
the end. Let us not, then, reason contrary to evidence. How can we 
ever be so ungenerous as to <i>doubt</i> our God? Lord, throw down the Jezebel of our unbelief, and let the 
dogs devour it.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1017pm-p3">Our good Shepherd has in his flock a variety of experiences, some 
are strong in the Lord, and others are weak in faith, but he is impartial 
in his care for all his sheep, and the weakest lamb is as dear to 
him as the most advanced of the flock. Lambs are wont to lag behind, 
prone to wander, and apt to grow weary, but from all the danger of 
these infirmities the Shepherd protects them with his arm of power. 
He finds new-born souls, like young lambs, ready to perish—he nourishes them till life becomes vigorous; he finds weak minds 
ready to faint and die—he consoles them and renews their strength. All the little ones he 
gathers, for it is not the will of our heavenly Father that one of 
them should perish. What a quick eye he must have to see them all! 
What a tender heart to care for them all! What a far- reaching and 
potent arm, to gather them all! In his lifetime on earth he was a 
great gatherer of the weaker sort, and now that he dwells in heaven, 
his loving heart yearns towards the meek and contrite, the timid and 
feeble, the fearful and fainting here below. How gently did he gather 
me to himself, to his truth, to his blood, to his love, to his church! 
With what effectual grace did he compel me to come to himself! Since 
my first conversion, how frequently has he restored me from my wanderings, 
and once again folded me within the circle of his everlasting arm! 
The best of all is, that he does it all himself personally, not delegating 
the task of love, but condescending himself to rescue and preserve 
his most unworthy servant. How shall I love him enough or serve him 
worthily? I would fain make his name great unto the ends of the earth, 
but what can my feebleness do for him? Great Shepherd, add to thy 
mercies this one other, a heart to love thee more truly as I ought.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1018am-p3">Many are “the paths of the Lord” which “drop fatness,” but an especial one is the <i>path of prayer</i>. No believer, who is much in the closet, will have need to cry, “My leanness, my leanness; woe unto me.” Starving souls live at a distance from the mercy- seat, and become 
like the parched fields in times of drought. Prevalence with God in 
wrestling prayer is sure to make the believer strong—if not happy. The nearest place to the gate of heaven is the throne 
of the heavenly grace. Much alone, and you will have much assurance; 
little alone with Jesus, your religion will be shallow, polluted with 
many doubts and fears, and not sparkling with the joy of the Lord. 
Since the soul-enriching path of prayer is open to the very weakest 
saint; since no high attainments are required; since you are not bidden 
to come because you are an advanced saint, but freely invited if you 
be a saint at all; see to it, dear reader, that you are often in the 
way of private devotion. Be much on your knees, for so Elijah drew 
the rain upon famished Israel’s fields.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1018am-p4">There is another especial path dropping with fatness to those who 
walk therein, it is the secret walk of communion. Oh! the delights 
of fellowship with Jesus! Earth hath no words which can set forth 
the holy calm of a soul leaning on Jesus’ bosom. Few Christians understand it, they live in the lowlands and 
seldom climb to the top of Nebo: they live in the outer court, they 
enter not the holy place, they take not up the privilege of priesthood. 
At a distance they see the sacrifice, but they sit not down with the 
priest to eat thereof, and to enjoy the fat of the burnt offering. 
But, reader, sit thou ever under the shadow of Jesus; come up to that 
palm tree, and take hold of the branches thereof; let thy beloved 
be unto thee as the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, and thou 
shalt be satisfied as with marrow and fatness. O Jesus, visit us with 
thy salvation!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1018pm-p3">Saul had been commanded to slay utterly all the Amalekites and their 
cattle. Instead of doing so, he preserved the king, and suffered his 
people to take the best of the oxen and of the sheep. When called 
to account for this, he declared that he did it with a view of offering 
sacrifice to God; but Samuel met him at once with the assurance that 
sacrifices were no excuse for an act of direct rebellion. The sentence 
before us is worthy to be printed in letters of gold, and to be hung 
up before the eyes of the present idolatrous generation, who are very 
fond of the fineries of will-worship, but utterly neglect the laws 
of God. Be it ever in your remembrance, that to keep strictly in the 
path of your Saviour’s command is better than any outward form of religion; and to hearken 
to his precept with an attentive ear is better than to bring the fat 
of rams, or any other precious thing to lay upon his altar. If you 
are failing to keep the least of Christ’s commands to his disciples, I pray you be disobedient no longer. 
All the pretensions you make of attachment to your Master, and all 
the devout actions which you may perform, are no recompense for disobedience. 
“To obey,” even in the slightest and smallest thing, “is better than sacrifice,” however pompous. Talk not of Gregorian chants, sumptuous robes, incense, 
and banners; the first thing which God requires of his child is obedience; 
and though you should give your body to be burned, and all your goods 
to feed the poor, yet if you do not hearken to the Lord’s precepts, all your formalities shall profit you nothing. It is a 
blessed thing to be teachable as a little child, but it is a much 
more blessed thing when one has been taught the lesson, to carry it 
out to the letter. How many adorn their temples and decorate their 
priests, but refuse to obey the word of the Lord! My soul, come not 
thou into their secret.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1019am-p3">Are you mourning, believer, because you are so weak in the divine 
life: because your faith is so little, your love so feeble? Cheer 
up, for you have cause for gratitude. Remember <i>that in some things you are equal to the greatest and most</i> <i>full-grown Christian</i>. You are as much bought with blood as he is. You are as much an adopted 
child of God as any other believer. An infant is as truly a child 
of its parents as is the full-grown man. You are as completely justified, 
for your justification is not a thing of degrees: your little faith 
has made you clean every whit. You have as much right to the precious 
things of the covenant as the most advanced believers, for your right 
to covenant mercies lies not in your growth, but in the covenant itself; 
and your faith in Jesus is not the measure, but the token of your 
inheritance in him. You are as rich as the richest, if not in enjoyment, 
yet in real possession. The smallest star that gleams is set in heaven; 
the faintest ray of light has affinity with the great orb of day. 
In the family register of glory the small and the great are written 
with the same pen. You are as dear to your Father’s heart as the greatest in the family. Jesus is very tender over you. 
You are like the smoking flax; a rougher spirit would say, “put out that smoking flax, it fills the room with an offensive odour!” but the smoking flax <i>he</i> will not quench. You are like a bruised reed; and any less tender 
hand than that of the Chief Musician would tread upon you or throw 
you away, but he will never break the bruised reed. Instead of being 
downcast by reason of what you are, you should triumph in Christ. 
Am I but little in Israel? Yet in Christ I am made to sit in heavenly 
places. Am I poor in faith? Still in Jesus I am heir of all things. 
Though “less than nothing I can boast, and vanity confess.” Yet, if the root of the matter be in me I will rejoice in the Lord, 
and glory in the God of my salvation.</p>

It is easy enough for an Aeolian harp to whisper music when the winds

It is easy to sing when we can read the notes by daylight; but he 
is skilful who sings when there is not a ray of light to read by—who sings from his heart. No man can make a song in the night of himself; 
he may attempt it, but he will find that a song in the night must 
be divinely inspired. Let all things go well, I can weave songs, fashioning 
them wherever I go out of the flowers that grow upon my path; but 
put me in a desert, where no green thing grows, and wherewith shall 
I frame a hymn of praise to God? How shall a mortal man make a crown 
for the Lord where no jewels are? Let but this voice be clear, and 
this body full of health, and I can sing God’s praise: silence my tongue, lay me upon the bed of languishing, and 
how shall I then chant God’s high praises, unless he himself give me the song? No, it is not 
in man’s power to sing when all is adverse, unless an altar-coal shall touch 
his lip. It was a divine song, which Habakkuk sang, when in the night 
he said, “Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in 
the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall 
yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there 
shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I 
will joy in the God of my salvation.” Then, since our Maker gives <i>songs in the</i> <i>night</i>, let us wait upon him for the music. O thou chief musician, let us 
not remain songless because affliction is upon us, but tune thou our 
lips to the melody of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1020am-p3">Many Christians remain stunted and dwarfed in spiritual things, so 
as to present the same appearance year after year. No up-springing 
of advanced and refined feeling is manifest in them. They exist but 
do not “<i>grow up into him in all</i> <i>things</i>.” But should we rest content with being in the “green blade,” when we might advance to “the ear,” and eventually ripen into the “full corn in the ear?” Should we be satisfied to believe in Christ, and to say, “I am safe,” without wishing to know in our own experience more of the fulness 
which is to be found in him. It should not be so; we should, as good 
traders in heaven’s market, covet to be enriched in the knowledge of Jesus. It is all 
very well to keep other men’s vineyards, but we must not neglect our own spiritual growth and 
ripening. Why should it always be winter time in our hearts? We must 
have our seed time, it is true, but O for a spring time—yea, a summer season, which shall give promise of an early harvest. 
If we would ripen in grace, we must live near to Jesus—in his presence—ripened by the sunshine of his smiles. We must hold sweet communion 
with him. We must leave the distant view of his face and come near, 
as John did, and pillow our head on his breast; then shall we find 
ourselves advancing in holiness, in love, in faith, in hope—yea, in every precious gift. As the sun rises first on mountain-tops 
and gilds them with his light, and presents one of the most charming 
sights to the eye of the traveller; so is it one of the most delightful 
contemplations in the world to mark the glow of the Spirit’s light on the head of some saint, who has risen up in spiritual stature, 
like Saul, above his fellows, till, like a mighty Alp, snow-capped, 
he reflects first among the chosen, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness, 
and bears the sheen of his effulgence high aloft for all to see, and 
seeing it, to glorify his Father which is in heaven.</p>

are naturally to all good things, and it is a lesson of grace to learn 
to go forward in the ways of God. Reader, are you unconverted, but 
do you desire to trust in the Lord Jesus? Then <i>keep not back</i>. Love invites you, the promises secure you success, the precious 
blood prepares the way. Let not sins or fears hinder you, but come 
to Jesus just as you are. Do you long to pray? Would you pour out 
your heart before the Lord? <i>Keep not back</i>. The mercy-seat is prepared for such as need mercy; a sinner’s cries will prevail with God. You are invited, nay, you are commanded 
to pray; come therefore with boldness to the throne of grace.</p>

it, lest it lead you into disobedience. There is a sweet promise made 
to those who confess Christ—by no means miss it, lest you come under the condemnation of those 
who deny him. If you have talents <i>keep</i> <i>not back</i> from using them. Hoard not your wealth, waste not your time; let 
not your abilities rust or your influence be unused. Jesus kept not 
back; imitate him by being foremost in self-denials and self-sacrifices. 
<i>Keep not back</i> from close communion with God, from boldly appropriating covenant 
blessings, from advancing in the divine life, from prying into the 
precious mysteries of the love of Christ. Neither, beloved friend, 
be guilty of keeping others back by your coldness, harshness, or suspicions. 
For Jesus’ sake go forward yourself, and encourage others to do the like. Hell 
and the leaguered bands of superstition and infidelity are forward 
to the fight. O soldiers of the cross, keep not back.</p>

he prepared heaven for thee? Has he prepared thee for heaven? Has 
he written thy name in his book of life? Has he given thee countless

you feel when your Master comes, if you have to confess that you <i>did</i> nothing for him, but kept your love shut up, like a stagnant pool, 
neither flowing forth to his poor or to his work. Out on such love 
as that! What do men think of a love which never shows itself in action? 
Why, they say, “Open rebuke is better than secret love.” Who will accept a love so weak that it does not actuate you to a 
single deed of self-denial, of generosity, of heroism, or zeal! Think 
how <i>he</i> has loved you, and given himself for you! Do you know the power of

swift as eagles in your Lord’s service. Love should give wings to the feet of service, and strength 
to the arms of labour. Fixed on God with a constancy that is not to 
be shaken, resolute to honour him with a determination that is not 
to be turned aside, and pressing on with an ardour never to be wearied, 
let us manifest the constraints of love to Jesus. May the divine lodestone

<p class="normal" id="d1021pm-p3">“Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest O Israel, my way is hid from

his universal providence, but his particular providence is over his 
saints. “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.” “Precious shall their blood be in his sight.” “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” “We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, 
to them that are the called according to his purpose.” Let the fact that, while he is the Saviour of all men, he is specially 
the Saviour of them that believe, cheer and comfort you. You are his

his eye; his vineyard over which he watches day and night. “The very hairs of your head are all numbered.” Let the thought of his special love <i>to you</i> be a spiritual pain-killer, a dear quietus to your woe: “I will never leave <i>thee</i>, nor forsake <i>thee</i>.” God says that as much to you as to any saint of old. “Fear not, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” We lose much consolation by the habit of reading his promises for 
the whole church, instead of taking them directly home to ourselves. 
Believer, grasp the divine word with a personal, appropriating faith. 
Think that you hear Jesus say, “I have prayed for <i>thee</i> that thy faith fail not.” Think you see him walking on the waters of thy trouble, for he is 
there, and he is saying, “Fear not, it is I; be not afraid.” Oh, those sweet words of Christ! May the Holy Ghost make you feel

<p class="normal" id="d1022am-p3">This sentence is a body of divinity in miniature. He who understands 
its meaning is a theologian, and he who can dive into its fulness 
is a true master in Israel. It is a condensation of the glorious message 
of salvation which was delivered to us in Christ Jesus our Redeemer. 
The sense hinges upon the word “freely.” This is the glorious, the suitable, the divine way by which love 
streams from heaven to earth, a spontaneous love flowing forth to 
those who neither deserved it, purchased it, nor sought after it. 
It is, indeed, the only way in which God can love such as we are. 
The text is a death-blow to all sorts of fitness: “I will love them <i>freely</i>.” Now, if there were any fitness necessary in us, then he would not 
love us freely; at least, this would be a mitigation and a drawback 
to the freeness of it. But it stands, “I will love you freely.” We complain, “Lord, my heart is so hard.” “I will love you <i>freely</i>.” “But I do not feel my need of Christ as I could wish.” “I will not love you because you feel your need; I will love you freely.” “But I do not feel that softening of spirit which I could desire.” Remember, the softening of spirit is not a condition, for there are 
no conditions; the covenant of grace has no conditionality whatever; 
so that we without any fitness may venture upon the promise of God 
which was made to us in Christ Jesus, when he said, “He that believeth on him is not condemned.” It is blessed to know that the grace of God is free to us at all 
times, without preparation, without fitness, without money, and without 
price! “I will love them freely.” These words <i>invite backsliders to return</i>: indeed, the text was specially written for such—“I will heal their backsliding; I will love them freely.” Backslider! surely the generosity of the promise will at once break 
your heart, and you will return, and seek your injured Father’s face.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1022pm-p3">There are times when all the promises and doctrines of the Bible are 
of no avail, unless a gracious hand shall apply them to us. We are 
thirsty, but too faint to crawl to the water-brook. When a soldier 
is wounded in battle it is of little use for him to know that there 
are those at the hospital who can bind up his wounds, and medicines 
there to ease all the pains which he now suffers: what he needs is 
to be carried thither, and to have the remedies applied. It is thus 
with our souls, and to meet this need there is one, even the Spirit 
of truth, who takes of the things of Jesus, and applies them to us. 
Think not that Christ hath placed his joys on heavenly shelves that 
we may climb up to them for ourselves, but he draws near, and sheds 
his peace abroad in our hearts. O Christian, if thou art tonight labouring 
under deep distresses, thy Father does not give thee promises and 
then leave thee to draw them up from the Word like buckets from a 
well, but the promises he has written in the Word he will write anew 
on your heart. He will manifest his love to you, and by his blessed 
Spirit, dispel your cares and troubles. Be it known unto thee, O mourner, 
that it is God’s prerogative to wipe every tear from the eye of his people. The good 
Samaritan did not say, “Here is the wine, and here is the oil for you;” he actually poured in the oil and the wine. So Jesus not only gives 
you the sweet wine of the promise, but holds the golden chalice to 
your lips, and pours the life-blood into your mouth. The poor, sick, 
way-worn pilgrim is not merely strengthened to walk, but he is borne 
on eagles’ wings. Glorious gospel! which provides everything for the helpless, 
which draws nigh to us when we cannot reach after it—brings us grace before we seek for grace! Here is as much glory in 
the giving as in the gift. Happy people who have the Holy Ghost to 
bring Jesus to them.</p>

Have you not up till now found your Lord to be a compassionate and

this world, or with the severer trials within the Church, we find

gold for dross? We will not forswear the sun till we find a better

bind his name as a seal upon our arm. As for <i>the future</i>, can you suggest anything which can arise that shall render it necessary

We think not. If life be long—he changes not. If we are poor, what better than to have Christ who

to make our bed in our sickness? When we die, is it not written that 
“neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, shall 
be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus 
our Lord!” We say with Peter, “Lord, to whom shall we go?”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1023pm-p3">When is the Christian most liable to sleep? Is it not <i>when</i> <i>his temporal circumstances are prosperous</i>? Have you not found it so? When you had daily troubles to take to 
the throne of grace, were you not more wakeful than you are now? Easy 
roads make sleepy travellers. Another dangerous time is <i>when all</i> <i>goes pleasantly in spiritual matters</i>. Christian went not to sleep when lions were in the way, or when 
he was wading through the river, or when fighting with Apollyon, but 
when he had climbed half way up the Hill Difficulty, and came to a 
delightful arbour, he sat down, and forthwith fell asleep, to his 
great sorrow and loss. The enchanted ground is a place of balmy breezes, 
laden with fragrant odours and soft influences, all tending to lull 
pilgrims to sleep. Remember Bunyan’s description: “Then they came to an arbour, warm, and promising much refreshing to 
the weary pilgrims; for it was finely wrought above head, beautified 
with greens, and furnished with benches and settles. It had also in 
it a soft couch, where the weary might lean.” “The arbour was called the Slothful’s Friend, and was made on purpose to allure, if it might be, some 
of the pilgrims to take up their rest there when weary.” Depend upon it, it is in easy places that men shut their eyes and 
wander into the dreamy land of forgetfulness. Old Erskine wisely remarked, 
“I like a roaring devil better than a sleeping devil.” There is no temptation half so dangerous as not being tempted. The 
distressed soul does not sleep; it is after we enter into peaceful 
confidence and full assurance that we are in danger of slumbering. 
The disciples fell asleep after they had seen Jesus transfigured on 
the mountain top. Take heed, joyous Christian, good frames are near 
neighbours to temptations: be as happy as you will, only be watchful.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1024am-p3">Without sap the tree cannot flourish or even exist. <i>Vitality</i> is essential to a Christian. There must be <i>life</i>—a vital principle infused into us by God the Holy Ghost, or we cannot 
be trees of the Lord. The mere name of being a Christian is but a 
dead thing, we must be filled with the spirit of divine life. This 
life is <i>mysterious</i>. We do not understand the circulation of the sap, by what force it 
rises, and by what power it descends again. So the life within us 
is a sacred mystery. Regeneration is wrought by the Holy Ghost entering 
into man and becoming man’s life; and this divine life in a believer afterwards feeds upon the 
flesh and blood of Christ and is thus sustained by divine food, but 
whence it cometh and whither it goeth who shall explain to us? What 
a <i>secret</i> thing the sap is! The roots go searching through the soil with their 
little spongioles, but we cannot see them suck out the various gases, 
or transmute the mineral into the vegetable; this work is done down 
in the dark. Our root is Christ Jesus, and our life is hid in him; 
this is the secret of the Lord. The radix of the Christian life is 
as secret as the life itself. How <i>permanently active</i> is the sap in the cedar! In the Christian the divine life is always 
full of energy—not always in fruit-bearing, but in inward operations. The believer’s <i>graces</i> are not every one of them in constant motion, but his <i>life</i> never ceases to palpitate within. He is not always working for God, 
but his heart is always living upon him. As the sap <i>manifests itself in producing the foliage and fruit of the tree</i>, so with a truly healthy Christian, his grace is externally manifested 
in his walk and conversation. If you talk with him, he cannot help 
speaking about Jesus. If you notice his actions you will see that 
he has been with Jesus. He has so much sap within, that it must fill 
his conduct and conversation with life.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1024pm-p3">The Lord Jesus loves his people so much, that every day he is still 
doing for them much that is analogous to washing their soiled feet. 
Their poorest actions he accepts; their deepest sorrow he feels; their 
slenderest wish he hears, and their every transgression he forgives. 
He is still their servant as well as their Friend and Master. He not 
only performs majestic deeds for them, as wearing the mitre on his 
brow, and the precious jewels glittering on his breastplate, and standing 
up to plead for them, but humbly, patiently, he yet goes about among 
his people with the basin and the towel. He does this when he puts 
away from us day by day our constant infirmities and sins. Last night, 
when you bowed the knee, you mournfully confessed that much of your 
conduct was not worthy of your profession; and even tonight, you must 
mourn afresh that you have fallen again into the selfsame folly and 
sin from which special grace delivered you long ago; and yet Jesus 
will have great patience with you; he will hear your confession of 
sin; he will say, “I will, be thou clean”; he will again apply the blood of sprinkling, and speak peace to 
your conscience, and remove every spot. It is a great act of eternal 
love when Christ once for all absolves the sinner, and puts him into 
the family of God; but what condescending patience there is when the 
Saviour with much long-suffering bears the oft recurring follies of 
his wayward disciple; day by day, and hour by hour, washing away the 
multiplied transgressions of his erring but yet beloved child! To 
dry up a flood of rebellion is something marvellous, but to endure 
the constant dropping of repeated offences—to bear with a perpetual trying of patience, this is divine indeed! 
While we find comfort and peace in our Lord’s daily cleansing, its legitimate influence upon us will be to increase 
our watchfulness, and quicken our desire for holiness. <i>Is it so</i>?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1025am-p3">Once let the truth of God obtain an entrance into the human heart 
and subdue the whole man unto itself, no power human or infernal can 
dislodge it. We entertain it not as a guest but as the master of the 
house—this is a <i>Christian necessity</i>, he is no Christian who doth not thus believe. Those who feel the 
vital power of the gospel, and know the might of the Holy Ghost as 
he opens, applies, and seals the Lord’s Word, would sooner be torn to pieces than be rent away from the 
gospel of their salvation. What a thousand mercies are wrapped up 
in the assurance that the truth will be with us forever; will be our 
living support, our dying comfort, our rising song, our eternal glory; 
this is <i>Christian privilege</i>, without it our faith were little worth. Some truths we outgrow and 
leave behind, for they are but rudiments and lessons for beginners, 
but we cannot thus deal with Divine truth, for though it is sweet 
food for babes, it is in the highest sense strong meat for men. The 
truth that we are sinners is painfully with us to humble and make 
us watchful; the more blessed truth that whosoever believeth on the 
Lord Jesus shall be saved, abides with us as our hope and joy. Experience, 
so far from loosening our hold of the doctrines of grace, has knit 
us to them more and more firmly; our grounds and motives for believing 
are now more strong, more numerous than ever, and we have reason to 
expect that it will be so till in death we clasp the Saviour in our 
arms.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1025am-p4">Wherever this abiding love of truth can be discovered, we are bound 
to exercise our love. No narrow circle can contain our gracious sympathies, 
wide as the election of grace must be our communion of heart. Much 
of error may be mingled with truth received, let us war with the error 
but still love the brother for the measure of truth which we see in 
him; above all let us love and spread the truth ourselves.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1025pm-p3">Her <i>hap was</i>. Yes, it seemed nothing but an accident, but how divinely was it 
overruled! Ruth had gone forth with her mother’s blessing, under the care of her mother’s God, to humble but honourable toil, and the providence of God was 
guiding her every step. Little did she know that amid the sheaves 
she would find a husband, that he should make her the joint owner 
of all those broad acres, and that she a poor foreigner should become 
one of the progenitors of the great Messiah. God is very good to those 
who trust in him, and often surprises them with unlooked for blessings. 
Little do we know what may happen to us to-morrow, but this sweet 
fact may cheer us, that no good thing shall be withheld. Chance is 
banished from the faith of Christians, for they see the hand of God 
in everything. The trivial events of today or to-morrow may involve 
consequences of the highest importance. O Lord, deal as graciously 
with thy servants as thou didst with Ruth.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1025pm-p4">How blessed would it be, if, in wandering in the field of meditation 
tonight, our hap should be to light upon the place where our next 
Kinsman will reveal himself to us! O Spirit of God, guide us to him. 
We would sooner glean in his field than bear away the whole harvest 
from any other. O for the footsteps of his flock, which may conduct 
us to the green pastures where he dwells! This is a weary world when 
Jesus is away—we could better do without sun and moon than without him—but how divinely fair all things become in the glory of his presence! 
Our souls know the virtue which dwells in Jesus, and can never be 
content without him. We will wait in prayer this night until our hap 
shall be to light on a part of the field belonging to Jesus wherein 
he will manifest himself to us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1026am-p3">Churlish souls stint their contributions to the ministry and missionary 
operations, and call such saving good economy; little do they dream 
that they are thus impoverishing themselves. Their excuse is that 
they must care for their own families, and they forget that to neglect 
the house of God is the sure way to bring ruin upon their own houses. 
Our God has a method in providence by which he can succeed our endeavours 
beyond our expectation, or can defeat our plans to our confusion and 
dismay; by a turn of his hand he can steer our vessel in a profitable 
channel, or run it aground in poverty and bankruptcy. It is the teaching 
of Scripture that the Lord enriches the liberal and leaves the miserly 
to find out that withholding tendeth to poverty. In a very wide sphere 
of observation, I have noticed that the most generous Christians of 
my acquaintance have been always the most happy, and almost invariably 
the most prosperous. I have seen the liberal giver rise to wealth 
of which he never dreamed; and I have as often seen the mean, ungenerous 
churl descend to poverty by the very parsimony by which he thought 
to rise. Men trust good stewards with larger and larger sums, and 
so it frequently is with the Lord; he gives by cartloads to those 
who give by bushels. Where wealth is not bestowed the Lord makes the 
little much by the contentment which the sanctified heart feels in 
a portion of which the tithe has been dedicated to the Lord. Selfishness 
looks first at home, but godliness seeks first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness, yet in the long run selfishness is loss, and 
godliness is great gain. It needs faith to act towards our God with 
an open hand, but surely he deserves it of us; and all that we can 
do is a very poor acknowledgment of our amazing indebtedness to his 
goodness.</p>

solid earth is a rolling ball, and the great sun himself a star obediently 
fulfilling its course around some greater luminary. Tides move the 
sea, winds stir the airy ocean, friction wears the rock: change and 
death rule everywhere. The sea is not a miser’s storehouse for a wealth of waters, for as by one force the waters 
flow into it, by another they are lifted from it. Men are born but 
to die: everything is hurry, worry, and vexation of spirit. Friend 
of the unchanging Jesus, what a joy it is to reflect upon thy changeless 
heritage; thy sea of bliss which will be forever full, since God himself 
shall pour eternal rivers of pleasure into it. We seek an abiding 
city beyond the skies, and we shall not be disappointed. The passage 
before us may well teach us gratitude. Father Ocean is a great receiver, 
but he is a generous distributor. What the rivers bring him he returns 
to the earth in the form of clouds and rain. That man is out of joint 
with the universe who takes all but makes no return. To give to others 
is but sowing seed for ourselves. He who is so good a steward as to 
be willing to use his substance for his Lord, shall be entrusted with 
more. Friend of Jesus, art thou rendering to him according to the 
benefit received? Much has been given thee, what is thy fruit? Hast 
thou done all? Canst thou not do more? To be selfish is to be wicked. 
Suppose the ocean gave up none of its watery treasure, it would bring 
ruin upon our race. God forbid that any of us should follow the ungenerous 
and destructive policy of living unto ourselves. Jesus pleased not 
himself. All fulness dwells in him, but of his fulness have all we 
received. O for Jesus’ spirit, that henceforth we may live not unto ourselves!</p>

life that now is, and of that which is to come. This is a faithful 
saying, and worthy of all acceptation.” The third is in <scripRef passage="2Ti 2:12" id="d1027am-p3.3" parsed="|2Tim|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.12">2 Timothy 2:12</scripRef>, “It is a faithful saying—If we suffer with him we shall also reign with him”; and the fourth is in <scripRef passage="Tit 3:3" id="d1027am-p3.4" parsed="|Titus|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Titus.3.3">Titus 3:3</scripRef>, “This is a faithful saying, that they which have believed in God might 
be careful to maintain good works.” We may trace a connection between these faithful sayings. The first 
one lays the foundation of our eternal salvation in the free grace 
of God, as shown to us in the mission of the great Redeemer. The next 
affirms the double blessedness which we obtain through this salvation—the blessings of the upper and nether springs—of time and of eternity. The third shows one of the duties to which 
the chosen people are called; we are ordained to suffer for Christ 
with the promise that “if we suffer, we shall also reign with him.” The last sets forth the active form of Christian service, bidding 
us diligently to maintain good works. Thus we have the root of salvation 
in free grace; next, the privileges of that salvation in the life 
which now is, and in that which is to come; and we have also the two 
great branches of suffering with Christ and serving with Christ, loaded 
with the fruits of the Spirit. Treasure up these faithful sayings. 
Let them be the guides of our life, our comfort, and our instruction. 
The apostle of the Gentiles proved them to be faithful, they are faithful 
still, not one word shall fall to the ground; they are worthy of all 
acceptation, let us accept them now, and prove their faithfulness. 
Let these four faithful sayings be written on the four corners of 
my house.</p>

from the natural man; but for all that the Christian is a sinner still. 
He is so from the imperfection of his nature, and will continue so 
to the end of his earthly life. The black fingers of sin leave smuts 
upon our fairest robes. Sin mars our repentance, ere the great Potter 
has finished it, upon the wheel. Selfishness defiles our tears, and 
unbelief tampers with our faith. The best thing we ever did apart 
from the merit of Jesus only swelled the number of our sins; for when 
we have been most pure in our own sight, yet, like the heavens, we 
are not pure in God’s sight; and as he charged his angels with folly, much more must he 
charge us with it, even in our most angelic frames of mind. The song 
which thrills to heaven, and seeks to emulate seraphic strains, hath 
human discords in it. The prayer which moves the arm of God is still 
a bruised and battered prayer, and only moves that arm because the 
sinless One, the great Mediator, has stepped in to take away the sin 
of our supplication. The most golden faith or the purest degree of 
sanctification to which a Christian ever attained on earth, has still 
so much alloy in it as to be only worthy of the flames, in itself 
considered. Every night we look in the glass we see a sinner, and 
had need confess, “We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as 
filthy rags.” Oh, how precious the blood of Christ to such hearts as ours! How 
priceless a gift is his perfect righteousness! And how bright the 
hope of perfect holiness hereafter! Even now, though sin dwells in 
us, <i>its power is broken</i>. It has no dominion; it is a broken-backed snake; we are in bitter 
conflict with it, but it is with a vanquished foe that we have to 
deal. Yet a little while and we shall enter victoriously into the 
city where nothing defileth.</p>

his throne, world without end. We will behold him tonight and adore

<p class="normal" id="d1029am-p3">This prayer begins where all true prayer must commence, with the spirit 
of <i>adoption</i>, “Our Father.” There is no acceptable prayer until we can say, “I will arise, and go unto my Father.” This child-like spirit soon perceives the grandeur of the Father 
“in heaven,” and ascends to <i>devout adoration</i>, “Hallowed be thy name.” The child lisping, “Abba, Father,” grows into the cherub crying, “Holy, Holy, Holy.” There is but a step from rapturous worship to the <i>glowing missionary spirit</i>, which is a sure outgrowth of filial love and reverent adoration—“Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” Next follows the heartfelt <i>expression of dependence</i> upon God—“Give us this day our daily bread.” Being further illuminated by the Spirit, he discovers that he is 
not only dependent, but sinful, hence he <i>entreats for mercy</i>, “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors:” and being pardoned, having the righteousness of Christ imputed, and 
knowing his acceptance with God, he humbly <i>supplicates for holy</i> <i>perseverance</i>, “Lead us not into temptation.” The man who is really forgiven, is anxious not to offend again; the 
possession of justification leads to an anxious desire for sanctification. 
“Forgive us our debts,” that is justification; “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,” that is sanctification in its negative and positive forms. As the 
result of all this, there follows a <i>triumphant ascription of praise</i>, “Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, 
Amen.” We rejoice that <i>our</i> King reigns in providence and shall reign in grace, from the river 
even to the ends of the earth, and of his dominion there shall be 
no end. Thus from a sense of adoption, up to fellowship with our reigning 
Lord, this short model of prayer conducts the soul. Lord, teach us 
thus to pray.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1029pm-p3">The disciples ought to have known Jesus, they had heard his voice 
so often, and gazed upon that marred face so frequently, that it is 
wonderful they did not discover him. Yet is it not so with you also? 
You have not seen Jesus lately. You have been to his table, and you 
have not met him there. You are in a dark trouble this evening, and 
though he plainly says, “It is I, be not afraid,” yet you cannot discern him. Alas! our eyes are holden. We know his 
voice; we have looked into his face; we have leaned our head upon 
his bosom, and yet, though Christ is very near us, we are saying “O that I knew where I might find him!” We should know Jesus, for we have the Scriptures to reflect his image, 
and yet how possible it is for us to open that precious book and have 
no glimpse of the Wellbeloved! Dear child of God, are you in that 
state? Jesus feedeth among the lilies of the word, and you walk among 
those lilies, and yet you behold him not. He is accustomed to walk 
through the glades of Scripture, and to commune with his people, as 
the Father did with Adam in the cool of the day, and yet you are in 
the garden of Scripture, but cannot see him, though he is always there. 
And why do we not see him? It must be ascribed in our case, as in 
the disciples’, to unbelief. They evidently did not expect to see Jesus, and therefore 
they did not know him. To a great extent in spiritual things we get 
what we expect of the Lord. Faith alone can bring us to see Jesus. 
Make it your prayer, “Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may see my Saviour present with 
me.” It is a blessed thing to want to see him; but oh! it is better far 
to gaze upon him. To those who seek him he is kind; but to those who 
find him, beyond expression is he dear!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1030am-p3">Praise should always follow answered prayer; as the mist of earth’s gratitude rises when the sun of heaven’s love warms the ground. Hath the Lord been gracious to thee, and 
inclined his ear to the voice of thy supplication? Then praise him 
as long as thou livest. Let the ripe fruit drop upon the fertile soil 
from which it drew its life. Deny not a song to him who hath answered 
thy prayer and given thee the desire of thy heart. To be silent over 
God’s mercies is to incur the guilt of ingratitude; it is to act as basely 
as the nine lepers, who after they had been cured of their leprosy, 
returned not to give thanks unto the healing Lord. To forget to praise 
God is to refuse to benefit ourselves; for praise, like prayer, is 
one great means of promoting the growth of the spiritual life. It 
helps to remove our burdens, to excite our hope, to increase our faith. 
It is a healthful and invigorating exercise which quickens the pulse 
of the believer, and nerves him for fresh enterprises in his Master’s service. To bless God for mercies received is also the way to benefit 
our fellow-men; “the humble shall hear thereof and be glad.” Others who have been in like circumstances shall take comfort if 
we can say, “Oh! magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together; 
this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him.” Weak hearts will be strengthened, and drooping saints will be revived 
as they listen to our “songs of deliverance.” Their doubts and fears will be rebuked, as we teach and admonish 
one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. They too shall 
“sing in the ways of the Lord,” when they hear us magnify his holy name. Praise is the most heavenly 
of Christian duties. The angels pray not, but they cease not to praise 
both day and night; and the redeemed, clothed in white robes, with 
palm-branches in their hands, are never weary of singing the new song, 
“Worthy is the Lamb.”</p>

he has left that garden, he now dwells in the garden of his church: 
there he unbosoms himself to those who keep his blessed company. That 
voice of love with which he speaks to his beloved is more musical 
than the harps of heaven. There is a depth of melodious love within 
it which leaves all human music far behind. Ten of thousands on earth, 
and millions above, are indulged with its harmonious accents. Some 
whom I well know, and whom I greatly envy, are at this moment hearkening 
to the beloved voice. O that I were a partaker of their joys! It is 
true some of these are poor, others bedridden, and some near the gates 
of death, but O my Lord, I would cheerfully starve with them, pine 
with them, or die with them, if I might but hear thy voice. Once I 
did hear it often, but I have grieved thy Spirit. Return unto me in 
compassion, and once again say unto me, “I am thy salvation.” No other voice can content me; I know thy voice, and cannot be deceived 
by another, let me hear it, I pray thee. I know not what thou wilt 
say, neither do I make any condition, O my Beloved, do but let me 
hear thee speak, and if it be a rebuke I will bless thee for it. Perhaps 
to cleanse my dull ear may need an operation very grievous to the 
flesh, but let it cost what it may I turn not from the one consuming 
desire, cause me to hear thy voice. Bore my ear afresh; pierce my 
ear with thy harshest notes, only do not permit me to continue deaf 
to thy calls. Tonight, Lord, grant thine unworthy one his desire, 
for I am thine, and thou hast bought me with thy blood. Thou hast 
opened mine eye to see thee, and the sight has saved me. Lord, open 
thou mine ear. I have read thy heart, now let me hear thy lips.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1031am-p3">A backslider, if there be a spark of life left in him will groan after 
restoration. In this renewal the same exercise of grace is required 
as at our conversion. We needed repentance then; we certainly need 
it now. We wanted faith that we might come to Christ at first; only 
the like grace can bring us to Jesus now. We wanted a word from the 
Most High, a word from the lip of the loving One, to end our fears 
then; we shall soon discover, when under a sense of present sin, that 
we need it now. No man can be renewed without as real and true a manifestation 
of the Holy Spirit’s energy as he felt at first, because the work is as great, and flesh 
and blood are as much in the way now as ever they were. Let thy personal 
weakness, O Christian, be an argument to make thee pray earnestly 
to thy God for help. Remember, David when he felt himself to be powerless, 
did not fold his arms or close his lips, but he hastened to the mercy-seat 
with “renew a right spirit within me.” Let not the doctrine that you, unaided, can do nothing, make you 
sleep; but let it be a goad in your side to drive you with an awful 
earnestness to Israel’s strong Helper. O that you may have grace to plead with God, as though 
you pleaded for your very life—“Lord, renew a right spirit within me.” He who <i>sincerely</i> prays to God to do this, will prove his honesty by using the means 
through which God works. Be much in prayer; live much upon the Word 
of God; kill the lusts which have driven your Lord from you; be careful 
to watch over the future uprisings of sin. The Lord has his own appointed 
ways; sit by the wayside and you will be ready when he passes by. 
Continue in all those blessed ordinances which will foster and nourish 
your dying graces; and, knowing that all the power must proceed from 
him, cease not to cry, “Renew a right spirit within me.”</p>

As a Church let us now draw nigh to the great head of the one Church

<p class="normal" id="d1102am-p3">It is well for us that, amidst all the variableness of life, there 
is One whom change cannot affect; One whose heart can never alter, 
and on whose brow mutability can make no furrows. All things else 
have changed—all things are changing. The sun itself grows dim with age; the world 
is waxing old; the folding up of the worn-out vesture has commenced; 
the heavens and earth must soon pass away; they shall perish, they 
shall wax old as doth a garment; but there is One who only hath immortality, 
of whose years there is no end, and in whose person there is no change. 
The delight which the mariner feels, when, after having been tossed 
about for many a day, he steps again upon the solid shore, is the 
satisfaction of a Christian when, amidst all the changes of this troublous 
life, he rests the foot of his faith upon this truth—“<i>I am the Lord, I change not</i>.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1102am-p4">The stability which the anchor gives the ship when it has at last 
obtained a hold-fast, is like that which the Christian’s hope affords him when it fixes itself upon this glorious truth. 
With God “is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” Whatever his attributes were of old, they are now; his power, his 
wisdom, his justice, his truth, are alike unchanged. He has ever been 
the refuge of his people, their stronghold in the day of trouble, 
and he is their sure Helper still. He is unchanged in his love. He 
has loved his people with “an everlasting love”; he loves them now as much as ever he did, and when all earthly things 
shall have melted in the last conflagration, his love will still wear 
the dew of its youth. Precious is the assurance that he changes not! 
The wheel of providence revolves, but its axle is eternal love.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1102pm-p3">My soul, feelest thou this holy shuddering at the sins of others? 
for otherwise thou lackest inward holiness. David's cheeks were wet 
with rivers of waters because of prevailing unholiness, Jeremiah desired 
eyes like fountains that he might lament the iniquities of Israel, 
and Lot was vexed with the conversation of the men of Sodom. Those 
upon whom the mark was set in Ezekiel's vision, were those who sighed 
and cried for the abominations of Jerusalem. It cannot but grieve 
gracious souls to see what pains men take to go to hell. They know 
the evil of sin experimentally, and they are alarmed to see others 
flying like moths into its blaze. Sin makes the righteous shudder, 
because it violates a holy law, which it is to every man's highest 
interest to keep; it pulls down the pillars of the commonwealth. Sin 
in others horrifies a believer, because it puts him in mind of the 
baseness of his own heart: when he sees a transgressor he cries with 
the saint mentioned by Bernard, "He fell today, and I may fall to-morrow." 
Sin to a believer is horrible, because it crucified the Saviour; he 
sees in every iniquity the nails and spear. How can a saved soul behold 
that cursed kill-Christ sin without abhorrence? Say, my heart, dost 
thou sensibly join in all this? It is an awful thing to insult God 
to His face. The good God deserves better treatment, the great God 
claims it, the just God will have it, or repay His adversary to his 
face. An awakened heart trembles at the audacity of sin, and stands 
alarmed at the contemplation of its punishment. How monstrous a thing 
is rebellion! How direful a doom is prepared for the ungodly! My soul, 
never laugh at sin's fooleries, lest thou come to smile at sin itself. 
It is thine enemy, and thy Lord's enemy. View it with detestation, 
for so only canst thou evidence the possession of holiness, without 
which no man can see the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1103am-p2">Prayers are instantly noticed in heaven. The moment Saul began to 
pray the Lord heard him. Here is comfort for the distressed but praying 
soul. Oftentimes a poor broken-hearted one bends his knee, but can 
only utter his wailing in the language of sighs and tears; yet that 
groan has made all the harps of heaven thrill with music; that tear 
has been caught by God and treasured in the lachrymatory of heaven. 
“Thou puttest my tears into thy bottle,” implies that they are caught as they flow. The suppliant, whose fears 
prevent his words, will be well understood by the Most High. He may 
only look up with misty eye; but “prayer is the falling of a tear.” Tears are the diamonds of heaven; sighs are a part of the music of 
Jehovah’s court, and are numbered with “the sublimest strains that reach the majesty on high.” Think not that your prayer, however weak or trembling, will be unregarded. 
Jacob’s ladder is lofty, but our prayers shall lean upon the Angel of the 
covenant and so climb its starry rounds. Our God not only <i>hears</i> prayer but also <i>loves</i> to hear it. “He forgetteth not the cry of the humble.” True, He regards not high looks and lofty words; He cares not for 
the pomp and pageantry of kings; He listens not to the swell of martial 
music; He regards not the triumph and pride of man; but wherever there 
is a heart big with sorrow, or a lip quivering with agony, or a deep 
groan, or a penitential sigh, the heart of Jehovah is open; He marks 
it down in the registry of His memory; He puts our prayers, like rose 
leaves, between the pages of His book of remembrance, and when the 
volume is opened at last, there shall be a precious fragrance springing 
up therefrom.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1103pm-p2">Prayer is the never-failing resort of the Christian in any case, in 
every plight. When you cannot use your sword you may take to the weapon 
of all-prayer. Your powder may be damp, your bow-string may be relaxed, 
but the weapon of all-prayer need never be out of order. Leviathan 
laughs at the javelin, but he trembles at prayer. Sword and spear 
need furbishing, but prayer never rusts, and when we think it most 
blunt it cuts the best. Prayer is an open door which none can shut. 
Devils may surround you on all sides, but the way upward is always 
open, and as long as that road is unobstructed, you will not fall 
into the enemy's hand. We can never be taken by blockade, escalade, 
mine, or storm, so long as heavenly succours can come down to us by 
Jacob's ladder to relieve us in the time of our necessities. Prayer 
is never out of season: in summer and in winter its merchandise is 
precious. Prayer gains audience with heaven in the dead of night, 
in the midst of business, in the heat of noonday, in the shades of 
evening. In every condition, whether of poverty, or sickness, or obscurity, 
or slander, or doubt, your covenant God will welcome your prayer and 
answer it from His holy place. Nor is prayer ever <i>futile</i>. True prayer is evermore true power. You may not always get what 
you ask, but you shall always have your real wants supplied. When 
God does not answer His children according to the letter, He does 
so according to the spirit. If thou askest for coarse meal, wilt thou 
be angered because He gives thee the finest flour? If thou seekest 
bodily health, shouldst thou complain if instead thereof He makes 
thy sickness turn to the healing of spiritual maladies? Is it not 
better to have the cross sanctified than removed? This evening, my 
soul, forget not to offer thy petition and request, for the Lord is 
ready to grant thee thy desires.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1104am-p3">A primary qualification for serving God with any amount of success, 
and for doing God’s work well and triumphantly, is a sense of our own weakness. When 
God’s warrior marches forth to battle, strong in his own might, when he 
boasts, “I know that I shall conquer, my own right arm and my conquering sword 
shall get unto me the victory,” defeat is not far distant. God will not go forth with that man who 
marches in his own strength. He who reckoneth on victory thus has 
reckoned wrongly, for “it is not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord 
of hosts.” They who go forth to fight, boasting of their prowess, shall return 
with their gay banners trailed in the dust, and their armour stained 
with disgrace. Those who serve God must serve him in his own way, 
and in his strength, or he will never accept their service. That which 
man doth, unaided by divine strength, God can never own. The mere 
fruits of the earth he casteth away; he will only reap that corn, 
the seed of which was sown from heaven, watered by grace, and ripened 
by the sun of divine love. God will empty out all that thou hast before 
he will put his own into thee; he will first clean out thy granaries 
before he will fill them with the finest of the wheat. The river of 
God is full of water; but not one drop of it flows from earthly springs. 
God will have no strength used in his battles but the strength which 
he himself imparts. Are you mourning over your own weakness? Take 
courage, for there must be a consciousness of weakness before the 
Lord will give thee victory. Your emptiness is but the preparation 
for your being filled, and your casting down is but the making ready 
for your lifting up.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1104pm-p3">No lips can tell the love of Christ to the heart till Jesus himself 
shall speak within. Descriptions all fall flat and tame unless the 
Holy Ghost fills them with life and power; till our Immanuel reveals 
himself within, the soul sees him not. If you would see the sun, would 
you gather together the common means of illumination, and seek in 
that way to behold the orb of day? No, the wise man knoweth that the 
sun must reveal itself, and only by its own blaze can that mighty 
lamp be seen. It is so with Christ. “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona:” said he to Peter, “for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee.” Purify flesh and blood by any educational process you may select, 
elevate mental faculties to the highest degree of intellectual power, 
yet none of these can reveal Christ. The Spirit of God must come with 
power, and overshadow the man with his wings, and then in that mystic 
holy of holies the Lord Jesus must display himself to the sanctified 
eye, as he doth not unto the purblind sons of men. Christ must be 
his own mirror. The great mass of this blear-eyed world can see nothing 
of the ineffable glories of Immanuel. He stands before them without 
form or comeliness, a root out of a dry ground, rejected by the vain 
and despised by the proud. Only where the Spirit has touched the eye 
with eye-salve, quickened the heart with divine life, and educated 
the soul to a heavenly taste, only there is he understood. “To you that believe he is precious;” to you he is the chief corner-stone, the Rock of your salvation, 
your all in all; but to others he is “a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.” Happy are those to whom our Lord manifests himself, for his promise 
to such is that he will <i>make his abode with them</i>. O Jesus, our Lord, our heart is open, come in, and go out no more 
forever. Show thyself to us now! Favour us with a glimpse of thine 
all-conquering charms.</p>

songs for repeated deliverances. Grant us more and more a hatred of 
Antichrist, and hasten on the day of her entire extinction. Till then

of Jesus on this day to plead for the overturning of false doctrines

our own hearts, and turn out any of the Popish lumber of self-righteousness

bare necessary, like to bread and water, but as a luxurious delicacy, 
as a rare and ravishing delight. To this end he has revealed himself

their highest honour to veil their faces at his feet. Consider what 
the blood-washed think of him, as day without night they sing his 
well deserved praises. High thoughts of Christ will enable us to act 
consistently with our relations towards him. The more loftily we see 
Christ enthroned, and the more lowly we are when bowing before the 
foot of the throne, the more truly shall we be prepared to act our 
part towards him. Our Lord Jesus desires us to think well of him, 
that we may submit cheerfully to his authority. High thoughts of him 
increase our love. Love and esteem go together. Therefore, believer, 
think much of your Master’s excellencies. Study him in his primeval glory, before he took upon 
himself your nature! Think of the mighty love which drew him from 
his throne to die upon the cross! Admire him as he conquers all the

as the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the mighty God, for only thus will 
your love to him be what it should.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1106am-p3">When a believer has fallen into a low, sad state of feeling, he often 
tries to lift himself out of it by chastening himself with dark and 
doleful fears. Such is not the way to rise from the dust, but to continue 
in it. As well chain the eagle’s wing to make it mount, as doubt in order to increase our grace. 
It is not the law, but the gospel which saves the seeking soul at 
first; and it is not a legal bondage, but gospel liberty which can 
restore the fainting believer afterwards. Slavish fear brings not 
back the backslider to God, but the sweet wooings of love allure him 
to Jesus’ bosom. Are you this morning thirsting for the living God, and unhappy 
because you cannot find him to the delight of your heart? Have you 
lost the joy of religion, and is this your prayer, “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation”? Are you conscious also that you are barren, like the dry ground; 
that you are not bringing forth the fruit unto God which he has a 
right to expect of you; that you are not so useful in the Church, 
or in the world, as your heart desires to be? Then here is exactly 
the promise which you need, “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty.” You shall receive the grace you so much require, and you shall have 
it to the utmost reach of your needs. Water refreshes the thirsty: 
you shall be refreshed; your desires shall be gratified. Water quickens 
sleeping vegetable life: your life shall be quickened by fresh grace. 
Water swells the buds and makes the fruits ripen; you shall have fructifying 
grace: you shall be made fruitful in the ways of God. Whatever good 
quality there is in divine grace, you shall enjoy it to the full. 
All the riches of divine grace you shall receive in plenty; you shall 
be as it were drenched with it: and as sometimes the meadows become 
flooded by the bursting rivers, and the fields are turned into pools, 
so shall you be—the thirsty land shall be springs of water.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1106pm-p3">There is a strange power about the very name of blood, and the sight 
of it is always affecting. A kind heart cannot bear to see a sparrow 
bleed, and unless familiarized by use, turns away with horror at the 
slaughter of a beast. As to the blood of men, it is a consecrated 
thing: it is murder to shed it in wrath, it is a dreadful crime to 
squander it in war. Is this solemnity occasioned by the fact that 
the blood is the life, and the pouring of it forth the token of death? 
We think so. When we rise to contemplate the blood of the Son of God, 
our awe is yet more increased, and we shudder as we think of the guilt 
of sin, and the terrible penalty which the Sin-bearer endured. Blood, 
always precious, is priceless when it streams from Immanuel’s side. The blood of Jesus seals the <i>covenant</i> of grace, and makes it forever sure. Covenants of old were made by 
sacrifice, and the everlasting covenant was ratified in the same manner. 
Oh, the delight of being saved upon the sure foundation of divine 
engagements which cannot be dishonoured! Salvation by the works of 
the law is a frail and broken vessel whose shipwreck is sure; but 
the covenant vessel fears no storms, for the blood ensures the whole. 
The blood of Jesus made his <i>testament</i> valid. Wills are of no power unless the testators die. In this light 
the soldier’s spear is a blessed aid to faith, since it proved our Lord to be 
really dead. Doubts upon that matter there can be none, and we may 
boldly appropriate the legacies which he has left for his people. 
Happy they who see their title to heavenly blessings assured to them 
by a dying Saviour. But has this blood no voice to us? Does it not 
bid us sanctify ourselves unto him by whom we have been redeemed? 
Does it not call us to newness of life, and incite us to entire consecration 
to the Lord? O that the power of the blood might be known, and felt 
in us this night!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1107am-p3">No doubt a part of the wonder which is concentrated in the word “<i>Behold</i>,” is excited by the unbelieving lamentation of the preceding sentence. 
Zion said, “The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.” How amazed the divine mind seems to be at this wicked unbelief! What 
can be more astounding than the unfounded doubts and fears of God’s favoured people? The Lord’s loving word of rebuke should make us blush; he cries, “How can I have forgotten thee, when I have graven thee upon the palms 
of my hands? How darest thou doubt my constant remembrance, when the 
memorial is set upon my very flesh?” O unbelief, how strange a marvel thou art! We know not which most 
to wonder at, the faithfulness of God or the unbelief of his people. 
He keeps his promise a thousand times, and yet the next trial makes 
us doubt him. He never faileth; he is never a dry well; he is never 
as a setting sun, a passing meteor, or a melting vapour; and yet we 
are as continually vexed with anxieties, molested with suspicions, 
and disturbed with fears, as if our God were the mirage of the desert. 
“Behold,” <i>is a</i> <i>word intended to excite admiration</i>. Here, indeed, we have a theme for marvelling. Heaven and earth may 
well be astonished that rebels should obtain so great a nearness to 
the heart of infinite love as to be written upon the palms of his 
hands. “I have graven <i>thee</i>.” It does not say, “Thy name.” The name is there, but that is not all: “I have graven <i>thee</i>.” See the fulness of this! I have graven thy person, thine image, thy 
case, thy circumstances, thy sins, thy temptations, thy weaknesses, 
thy wants, thy works; I have graven thee, everything about thee, all 
that concerns thee; I have put thee altogether there. Wilt thou ever 
say again that thy God hath forsaken thee when he has graven thee 
<i>upon</i> his own palms?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1107pm-p3">In order to learn how to discharge your duty as a witness for Christ, 
look at his example. He is always witnessing: by the well of Samaria, 
or in the Temple of Jerusalem: by the lake of Gennesaret, or on the 
mountain’s brow. He is witnessing night and day; his mighty prayers are as 
vocal to God as his daily services. He witnesses under all circumstances; 
Scribes and Pharisees cannot shut his mouth; even before Pilate he 
witnesses a good confession. He witnesses so clearly, and distinctly 
that there is no mistake in him. Christian, make your life a clear 
testimony. Be you as the brook wherein you may see every stone at 
the bottom—not as the muddy creek, of which you only see the surface—but clear and transparent, so that your heart’s love to God and man may be visible to all. You need not say, “I am true:” be true. Boast not of integrity, but be upright. So shall your testimony 
be such that men cannot help seeing it. Never, for fear of feeble 
man, restrain your witness. Your lips have been warmed with a coal 
from off the altar; let them speak as like heaven-touched lips should 
do. “In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine 
hand.” Watch not the clouds, consult not the wind—in season and out of season witness for the Saviour, and if it shall 
come to pass that for Christ’s sake and the gospel’s you shall endure suffering in any shape, shrink not, but rejoice 
in the honour thus conferred upon you, that you are counted worthy 
to suffer with your Lord; and joy also in this—that your sufferings, your losses, and persecutions shall make you 
a platform, from which the more vigorously and with greater power 
you shall witness for Christ Jesus. Study your great Exemplar, and 
be filled with his Spirit. Remember that you need much teaching, much 
upholding, much grace, and much humility, if your witnessing is to 
be to your Master’s glory.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1108am-p3">The life of faith is represented as <i>receiving—an act which</i> <i>implies the very opposite of anything like merit</i>. It is simply the acceptance of a gift. As the earth drinks in the 
rain, as the sea receives the streams, as night accepts light from 
the stars, so we, giving nothing, partake freely of the grace of God. 
The saints are not, by nature, wells, or streams, they are but cisterns 
into which the living water flows; they are empty vessels into which 
God pours his salvation. The idea of receiving implies <i>a sense of realization</i>, making the matter a <i>reality</i>. One cannot very well receive a shadow; we receive that which is 
substantial: so is it in the life of faith, Christ becomes real to 
us. While we are without faith, Jesus is a mere name to us—a person who lived a long while ago, so long ago that his life is 
only a history to us now! By an act of faith Jesus becomes a real 
person in the consciousness of our heart. But receiving also means 
<i>grasping or getting</i> <i>possession of</i>. The thing which I receive becomes my own: I appropriate to myself 
that which is given. When I receive Jesus, he becomes my Saviour, 
so mine that neither life nor death shall be able to rob me of him. 
All this is to receive Christ—to take him as God’s free gift; to realize him in my heart, and to appropriate him as 
mine.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1108am-p4">Salvation may be described as the blind receiving sight, the deaf 
receiving hearing, the dead receiving life; but we have not only received 
these blessings, we have received <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1108am-p4.1">Christ Jesus</span>  himself. It is true that he gave us life from the dead. He gave 
us pardon of sin; he gave us imputed righteousness. These are all 
precious things, but we are not content with them; we have received 
<i>Christ himself</i>. The Son of God has been poured into us, and we have received him, 
and appropriated him. What a heartful Jesus must be, for heaven itself 
cannot contain him!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1108pm-p3">Jerusalem at the time of the passover was one great inn; each householder 
had invited his own friends, but no one had invited the Saviour, and 
he had no dwelling of his own. It was by his own supernatural power 
that he found himself an upper room in which to keep the feast. It 
is so even to this day—Jesus is not received among the sons of men save only where by his 
supernatural power and grace he makes the heart anew. All doors are 
open enough to the prince of darkness, but Jesus must clear a way 
for himself or lodge in the streets. It was through the mysterious 
power exerted by our Lord that the householder raised no question, 
but at once cheerfully and joyfully opened his guestchamber. Who he 
was, and what he was, we do not know, but he readily accepted the 
honour which the Redeemer proposed to confer upon him. In like manner 
it is still discovered who are the Lord’s chosen, and who are not; for when the gospel comes to some, they 
fight against it, and will not have it, but where men receive it, 
welcoming it, this is a sure indication that there is a secret work 
going on in the soul, and that God has chosen them unto eternal life. 
Are you willing, dear reader, to receive Christ? then there is no 
difficulty in the way; Christ will be your guest; his own power is 
working with you, making you willing. What an honour to entertain 
the Son of God! The heaven of heavens cannot contain him, and yet 
he condescends to find a house within our hearts! We are not worthy 
that he should come under our roof, but what an unutterable privilege 
when he condescends to enter! for then he makes a feast, and causes 
us to feast with him upon royal dainties, we sit at a banquet where 
the viands are immortal, and give immortality to those who feed thereon. 
Blessed among the sons of Adam is he who entertains the angels’ Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1109am-p3">If we have received Christ himself in our inmost hearts, our new life 
will manifest its intimate acquaintance with him by <i>a</i> <i>walk of faith in him</i>. Walking implies <i>action</i>. Our religion is not to be confined to our closet; we must carry 
out into practical effect that which we believe. If a man walks in 
Christ, then he so acts as Christ would act; for Christ being in him, 
his hope, his love, his joy, his life, he is the reflex of the image 
of Jesus; and men say of that man, “He is like his Master; he lives like Jesus Christ.” Walking signifies <i>progress</i>. “So walk ye in him”; proceed from grace to grace, run forward until you reach the uttermost 
degree of knowledge that a man can attain concerning our Beloved. 
Walking implies <i>continuance</i>. There must be a perpetual abiding in Christ. How many Christians 
think that in the morning and evening they ought to come into the 
company of Jesus, and may then give their hearts to the world all 
the day: but this is poor living; we should always be with him, treading 
in his steps and doing his will. Walking also implies <i>habit</i>. When we speak of a man’s walk and conversation, we mean his habits, the constant tenor of 
his life. Now, if we sometimes enjoy Christ, and then forget him; 
sometimes call him ours, and anon lose our hold, that is not a habit; 
we do not <i>walk</i> in him. We must keep to him, cling to him, never let him go, but 
live and have our being in him. “As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him”; persevere in the same way in which ye have begun, and, as at the 
first Christ Jesus was the trust of your faith, the source of your 
life, the principle of your action, and the joy of your spirit, so 
let him be the same till life’s end; the same when you walk through the valley of the shadow of 
death, and enter into the joy and the rest which remain for the people 
of God. O Holy Spirit, enable us to obey this heavenly precept.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1109pm-p3">Do you doubt, O Christian, do you doubt as to whether God will fulfil 
his promise? Shall the munitions of rock be carried by storm? Shall 
the storehouses of heaven fail? Do you think that your heavenly Father, 
though he knoweth that you have need of food and raiment, will yet 
forget you? When not a sparrow falls to the ground without your Father, 
and the very hairs of your head are all numbered, will you mistrust 
and doubt him? Perhaps your affliction will continue upon you till 
you dare to trust your God, and then it shall end. Full many there 
be who have been tried and sore vexed till at last they have been 
driven in sheer desperation to exercise faith in God, and the moment 
of their faith has been the instant of their deliverance; they have 
seen whether God would keep his promise or not. Oh, I pray you, doubt 
him no longer! Please not Satan, and vex not yourself by indulging 
any more those hard thoughts of God. Think it not a light matter to 
doubt Jehovah. Remember, it is a <i>sin</i>; and not a little sin either, but in the highest degree criminal. 
The angels never doubted him, nor the devils either: we alone, out 
of all the beings that God has fashioned, dishonour him by unbelief, 
and tarnish his honour by mistrust. Shame upon us for this! Our God 
does not deserve to be so basely suspected; in our past life we have 
proved him to be true and faithful to his word, and with so many instances 
of his love and of his kindness as we have received, and are daily 
receiving, at his hands, it is base and inexcusable that we suffer 
a doubt to sojourn within our heart. May we henceforth wage constant 
war against doubts of our God—enemies to our peace and to his honour; and with an unstaggering faith 
believe that what he has promised he will also perform. “Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1110am-p3">The word refuge may be translated “mansion,” or “abiding- place,” which gives the thought that <i>God is our abode, our</i> <i>home</i>. There is a fulness and sweetness in the metaphor, for dear to our 
hearts is our home, although it be the humblest cottage, or the scantiest 
garret; and dearer far is our blessed God, in whom we live, and move, 
and have our being. It is at home that we <i>feel safe</i>: we shut the world out and dwell in quiet security. So when we are 
with our God we “fear no evil.” He is our shelter and retreat, our abiding refuge. At home, <i>we</i> <i>take our rest</i>; it is there we find repose after the fatigue and toil of the day. 
And so our hearts find rest in God, when, wearied with life’s conflict, we turn to him, and our soul dwells at ease. At home, 
also, we <i>let our hearts loose</i>; we are not afraid of being misunderstood, nor of our words being 
misconstrued. So when we are with God we can commune freely with him, 
laying open all our hidden desires; for if the “secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,” the secrets of them that fear him ought to be, and must be, with 
their Lord. Home, too, is the place of our <i>truest and purest happiness</i>: and it is in God that our hearts find their deepest delight. We 
have joy in him which far surpasses all other joy. <i>It is also for home</i> <i>that we work and labour</i>. The thought of it gives strength to bear the daily burden, and quickens 
the fingers to perform the task; and in this sense we may also say 
that God is our home. Love to him strengthens us. We think of him 
in the person of his dear Son; and a glimpse of the suffering face 
of the Redeemer constrains us to labour in his cause. We feel that 
we must work, for we have brethren yet to be saved, and we have our 
Father’s heart to make glad by bringing home his wandering sons; we would 
fill with holy mirth the sacred family among whom we dwell. Happy 
are those who have thus the God of Jacob for their refuge!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1110pm-p3">No one will dispute this statement, for it would be unseemly for the 
servant to be exalted above his Master. When our Lord was on earth, 
what was the treatment he received? Were his claims acknowledged, 
his instructions followed, his perfections worshipped, by those whom 
he came to bless? No; “He was despised and rejected of men.” Outside the camp was his place: cross-bearing was his occupation. 
Did the world yield him solace and rest? “Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son 
of man hath not where to lay his head.” This inhospitable country afforded him no shelter: it cast him out 
and crucified him. Such—if you are a follower of Jesus, and maintain a consistent, Christ-like 
walk and conversation—you must expect to be the lot of that part of your spiritual life 
which, in its outward development, comes under the observation of 
men. They will treat it as they treated the Saviour—they will despise it. Dream not that worldlings will admire you, or 
that the more holy and the more Christ-like you are, the more peaceably 
people will act towards you. They prized not the polished gem, how 
should they value the jewel in the rough? “If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more 
shall they call them of his household?” If we were more like Christ, we should be more hated by his enemies. 
It were a sad dishonour to a child of God to be the world’s favourite. It is a very ill omen to hear a wicked world clap its 
hands and shout “Well done” to the Christian man. He may begin to look to his character, and 
wonder whether he has not been doing wrong, when the unrighteous give 
him their approbation. Let us be true to our Master, and have no friendship 
with a blind and base world which scorns and rejects him. Far be it 
from us to seek a crown of honour where our Lord found a coronet of 
thorns.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1111am-p3">God—the eternal God—is himself our support at all times, and especially when we are sinking 
in deep trouble. There are seasons when the Christian <i>sinks very low in humiliation</i>. Under a deep sense of his great sinfulness, he is humbled before 
God till he scarcely knows how to pray, because he appears, in his 
own sight, so worthless. Well, child of God, remember that when thou 
art at thy worst and lowest, yet “underneath” thee “are everlasting arms.” Sin may drag thee ever so low, but Christ’s great atonement is still under all. You may have descended into 
the deeps, but you cannot have fallen so low as “the uttermost;” and to the uttermost he saves. Again, the Christian sometimes sinks 
very deeply in <i>sore trial from</i> <i>without</i>. Every earthly prop is cut away. What then? Still underneath him 
are “the everlasting arms.” He cannot fall so deep in distress and affliction but what the covenant 
grace of an ever-faithful God will still encircle him. The Christian 
may be sinking under <i>trouble from within through</i> fierce conflict, but even then he cannot be brought so low as to 
be beyond the reach of the “everlasting arms”—they are underneath him; and, while thus sustained, all Satan’s efforts to harm him avail nothing.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1111am-p4">This assurance of support is a comfort to any <i>weary but</i> <i>earnest worker</i> in the service of God. It implies a promise of strength for each 
day, grace for each need, and power for each duty. And, further, <i>when death comes</i>, the promise shall still hold good. When we stand in the midst of 
Jordan, we shall be able to say with David, “I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.” We shall descend into the grave, but we shall go no lower, for the 
eternal arms prevent our further fall. All through life, and at its 
close, we shall be upheld by the “everlasting arms”—arms that neither flag nor lose their strength, for “the everlasting God fainteth not, neither is weary.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1111pm-p3">Believer, if your inheritance be a lowly one you should be satisfied 
with your earthly portion; for you may rest assured that it is the 
fittest <i>for you</i>. Unerring wisdom ordained your lot, and selected for you the safest 
and best condition. A ship of large tonnage is to be brought up the 
river; now, in one part of the stream there is a sandbank; should 
some one ask, “Why does the captain steer through the deep part of the channel and 
deviate so much from a straight line?” His answer would be, “Because I should not get my vessel into harbour at all if I did not 
keep to the deep channel.” So, it may be, you would run aground and suffer shipwreck, if your 
divine Captain did not steer you into the depths of affliction where 
waves of trouble follow each other in quick succession. Some plants 
die if they have too much sunshine. It may be that you are planted 
where you get but little, you are put there by the loving Husbandman, 
because only in that situation will you bring forth fruit unto perfection. 
Remember this, had any other condition been better for you than the 
one in which you are, divine love would have put you there. You are 
placed by God in the most suitable circumstances, and if you had the 
choosing of your lot, you would soon cry, “Lord, choose my inheritance for me, for by my self-will I am pierced 
through with many sorrows.” Be content with such things as you have, since the Lord has ordered 
all things for your good. Take up your own daily cross; it is the 
burden best suited for your shoulder, and will prove most effective 
to make you perfect in every good word and work to the glory of God. 
Down busy self, and proud impatience, it is not for you to choose, 
but for the Lord of Love!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1112am-p3">Faith untried may be true faith, but it is sure to be little faith, 
and it is likely to remain dwarfish so long as it is without trials. 
Faith never prospers so well as when all things are against her: tempests 
are her trainers, and lightnings are her illuminators. When a calm 
reigns on the sea, spread the sails as you will, the ship moves not 
to its harbour; for on a slumbering ocean the keel sleeps too. Let 
the winds rush howling forth, and let the waters lift up themselves, 
then, though the vessel may rock, and her deck may be washed with 
waves, and her mast may creak under the pressure of the full and swelling 
sail, it is then that she makes headway towards her desired haven. 
No flowers wear so lovely a blue as those which grow at the foot of 
the frozen glacier; no stars gleam so brightly as those which glisten 
in the polar sky; no water tastes so sweet as that which springs amid 
the desert sand; and no faith is so precious as that which lives and 
triumphs in adversity. Tried faith brings experience. You could not 
have believed your own weakness had you not been compelled to pass 
through the rivers; and you would never have known God’s strength had you not been supported amid the water-floods. Faith 
increases in solidity, assurance, and intensity, the more it is exercised 
with tribulation. Faith is precious, and its trial is precious too.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1112am-p4">Let not this, however, discourage those who are young in faith. You 
will have trials enough without seeking them: the full portion will 
be measured out to you in due season. Meanwhile, if you cannot yet 
claim the result of long experience, thank God for what grace you 
have; praise him for that degree of holy confidence whereunto you 
have attained: walk according to that rule, and you shall yet have 
more and more of the blessing of God, till your faith shall remove 
mountains and conquer impossibilities.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1112pm-p3">If ever one of woman born might have lived without prayer, it was 
our spotless, perfect Lord, and yet none was ever so much in supplication 
as he! Such was his love to his Father, that he loved much to be in 
communion with him: such his love for his people, that he desired 
to be much in intercession for them. <i>The fact</i> of this eminent prayerfulness of Jesus is a lesson for us—he hath given us an example that we may follow in his steps. <i>The time</i> he chose was admirable, it was the hour of silence, when the crowd 
would not disturb him; the time of inaction, when all but himself 
had ceased to labour; and the season when slumber made men forget 
their woes, and cease their applications to him for relief. While 
others found rest in sleep, he refreshed himself with prayer. <i>The place</i> was also well selected. He was alone where none would intrude, where 
none could observe: thus was he free from Pharisaic ostentation and 
vulgar interruption. Those dark and silent hills were a fit oratory 
for the Son of God. Heaven and earth in midnight stillness heard the 
groans and sighs of the mysterious Being in whom both worlds were 
blended. <i>The continuance</i> of his pleadings is remarkable; the long watches were not too long; 
the cold wind did not chill his devotions; the grim darkness did not 
darken his faith, or loneliness check his importunity. We cannot watch 
with him one hour, but he watched for us whole nights. <i>The occasion</i> for this prayer is notable; it was after his enemies had been enraged—prayer was his refuge and solace; it was before he sent forth the 
twelve apostles—prayer was the gate of his enterprise, the herald of his new work. 
Should we not learn from Jesus to resort to special prayer when we 
are under peculiar trial, or contemplate fresh endeavours for the 
Master’s glory? Lord Jesus, teach us to pray.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1113am-p3">How did you begin to bear fruit? It was when you came to Jesus and 
cast yourselves on his great atonement, and rested on his finished 
righteousness. Ah! what fruit you had then! Do you remember those 
early days? Then indeed the vine flourished, the tender grape appeared, 
the pomegranates budded forth, and the beds of spices gave forth their 
smell. Have you declined since then? If you have, we charge you to 
remember that time of love, and repent, and do thy first works. <i>Be most in those</i> <i>engagements which you have experimentally proved to draw you</i> <i>nearest to Christ</i>, because it is from him that all your fruits proceed. Any holy exercise 
which will bring you to him will help you to bear fruit. The sun is, 
no doubt, a great worker in fruit-creating among the trees of the 
orchard: and Jesus is still more so among the trees of his garden 
of grace. When have you been the most fruitless? Has not it been when 
you have lived farthest from the Lord Jesus Christ, when you have 
slackened in prayer, when you have departed from the simplicity of 
your faith, when your graces have engrossed your attention instead 
of your Lord, when you have said, “My mountain standeth firm, I shall never be moved”; and have forgotten where your strength dwells—has not it been <i>then</i> that your fruit has ceased? Some of us have been taught that we have 
nothing out of Christ, by terrible abasements of heart before the 
Lord; and when we have seen the utter barrenness and death of all 
creature power, we have cried in anguish, “From him all my fruit must be found, for no fruit can ever come from 
me.” We are taught, by past experience, that the more simply we depend 
upon the grace of God in Christ, and wait upon the Holy Spirit, the 
more we shall bring forth fruit unto God. Oh! to trust Jesus for fruit 
as well as for life.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1113pm-p3">If <i>men</i> ought always to pray and not to faint, much more Christian men. Jesus 
has sent his church into the world on the same errand upon which he 
himself came, and this mission includes intercession. What if I say 
that the church is the world’s priest? Creation is dumb, but the church is to find a mouth for 
it. It is the church’s high privilege to pray with acceptance. The door of grace is always 
open for her petitions, and they never return empty-handed. The veil 
was rent <i>for</i> <i>her</i>, the blood was sprinkled upon the altar <i>for her</i>, God constantly invites her to ask what she wills. Will she refuse 
the privilege which angels might envy her? Is she not the bride of 
Christ? May she not go in unto her King at every hour? Shall she allow 
the precious privilege to be unused? The church always has need for 
prayer. There are always some in her midst who are declining, or falling 
into open sin. There are lambs to be prayed for, that they may be 
carried in Christ’s bosom? the strong, lest they grow presumptuous; and the weak, lest 
they become despairing. If we kept up prayer-meetings four-and-twenty 
hours in the day, all the days in the year, we might never be without 
a special subject for supplication. Are we ever without the sick and 
the poor, the afflicted and the wavering? Are we ever without those 
who seek the conversion of relatives, the reclaiming of back-sliders, 
or the salvation of the depraved? Nay, with congregations constantly 
gathering, with ministers always preaching, with millions of sinners 
lying dead in trespasses and sins; in a country over which the darkness 
of Romanism is certainly descending; in a world full of idols, cruelties, 
devilries, if the church doth not pray, how shall she excuse her base 
neglect of the commission of her loving Lord? Let the church be constant 
in supplication, let every private believer cast his mite of prayer 
into the treasury.</p>

they went with the followers of Jehovah, and bowed at the same time 
to Malcham. But duplicity is abominable with God, and hypocrisy his 
soul hateth. The idolater who distinctly gives himself to his false 
god, has one sin less than he who brings his polluted and detestable 
sacrifice unto the temple of the Lord, while his heart is with the 
world and the sins thereof. To hold with the hare and run with the 
hounds, is a dastard’s policy. In the common matters of daily life, a double- minded man 
is despised, but in religion he is loathsome to the last degree. The 
penalty pronounced in the verse before us is terrible, but it is well 
deserved; for how should divine justice spare the sinner, who knows 
the right, approves it, and professes to follow it, and all the while 
loves the evil, and gives it dominion in his heart?</p>

the family of old Father Honest, or art thou a relative of Mr. By-ends? 
A name to live is of little value if I be indeed dead in trespasses 
and sins. To have one foot on the land of truth, and another on the 
sea of falsehood, will involve a terrible fall and a total ruin. Christ 
will be all or nothing. God fills the whole universe, and hence there 
is no room for another god; if, then, he reigns in my heart, there 
will be no space for another reigning power. Do I rest alone on Jesus 
crucified, and live alone for him? Is it my desire to do so? Is my 
heart set upon so doing? If so, blessed be the mighty grace which 
has led me to salvation; and if not so, O Lord, pardon my sad offence,

secure the first. The second may be the more lovely in our eyes, but 
the rule of the heavenly country must stand, and the elder must be 
married first. For instance, many men desire the beautiful and well-favoured 
Rachel of joy and peace in believing, but they must first be wedded 
to the tender-eyed Leah of repentance. Every one falls in love with 
happiness, and many would cheerfully serve twice seven years to enjoy 
it, but according to the rule of the Lord’s kingdom, the Leah of real holiness must be beloved of our soul before 
the Rachel of true happiness can be attained. Heaven stands not first

the ill-favoured things for the sake of the sweet love of Jesus, which 
will recompense thee for all. In such a spirit, labouring and suffering, 
thou wilt find bitters grow sweet, and hard things easy. Like Jacob, 
thy years of service will seem unto thee but a few days for the love 
thou hast to Jesus; and when the dear hour of the wedding feast shall

<p class="normal" id="d1115pm-p3">It is our wisdom, as well as our necessity, to beseech God continually 
to strengthen that which he has wrought in us. It is because of their 
neglect in this, that many Christians may blame themselves for those 
trials and afflictions of spirit which arise from unbelief. It is 
true that Satan seeks to flood the fair garden of the heart and make 
it a scene of desolation, but it is also true that many Christians 
leave open the sluice-gates themselves, and let in the dreadful deluge 
through carelessness and want of prayer to their strong Helper. We 
often forget that the Author of our faith must be the Preserver of 
it also. The lamp which was burning in the temple was never allowed 
to go out, but it had to be daily replenished with fresh oil; in like 
manner, our faith can only live by being sustained with the oil of 
grace, and we can only obtain this from God himself. Foolish virgins 
we shall prove, if we do not secure the needed sustenance for our 
lamps. He who built the world upholds it, or it would fall in one 
tremendous crash; he who made us Christians must maintain us by his 
Spirit, or our ruin will be speedy and final. Let us, then, evening 
by evening, go to our Lord for the grace and strength we need. We 
have a strong argument to plead, for it is <i>his own work of grace</i> which we ask him to strengthen—“<i>that which thou hast wrought for us</i>.” Think you he will fail to protect and sustain that? Only let your 
faith take hold of his strength, and all the powers of darkness, led 
on by the master fiend of hell, cannot cast a cloud or shadow over 
your joy and peace. Why faint when you may be strong? Why suffer defeat 
when you may conquer? Oh! take your wavering faith and drooping graces 
to him who can revive and replenish them, and earnestly pray, “Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1116am-p3">It is not “The Lord is <i>partly</i> my portion,” nor “The Lord is <i>in</i> my portion”; but he himself makes up the sum total of my soul’s inheritance. Within the circumference of that circle lies all that 
we possess or desire. The <i>Lord</i> is my portion. Not his grace merely, nor his love, nor his covenant, 
but Jehovah himself. He has chosen us for his portion, and we have 
chosen him for ours. It is true that the Lord must first choose our 
inheritance for us, or else we shall never choose it for ourselves; 
but if we are really called according to the purpose of electing love, 
we can sing—</p>
<verse id="d1116am-p3.1">

<p class="normal" id="d1116am-p4">The Lord is our <i>all-sufficient</i> portion. God fills himself; and if God is all-sufficient in himself, 
he must be all- sufficient for us. It is not easy to satisfy man’s desires. When he dreams that he is satisfied, anon he wakes to the 
perception that there is somewhat yet beyond, and straightway the 
horse-leech in his heart cries, “Give, give.” But all that we can wish for is to be found in our divine portion, 
so that we ask, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that 
I desire beside thee.” Well may we “delight ourselves in the Lord” who makes us to drink of the river of his pleasures. Our faith stretches 
her wings and mounts like an eagle into the heaven of divine love 
as to her proper dwelling-place. “The lines have fallen to us in pleasant places; yea, we have a goodly 
heritage.” Let us rejoice in the Lord always; let us show to the world that 
we are a happy and a blessed people, and thus induce them to exclaim, 
“We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1116pm-p3">The more you know about Christ the less will you be satisfied with 
superficial views of him; and the more deeply you study his transactions 
in the eternal covenant, his engagements on your behalf as the eternal 
Surety, and the fulness of his grace which shines in all his offices, 
the more truly will you see the King in his beauty. Be much in such 
outlooks. Long more and more to see Jesus. <i>Meditation and contemplation</i> are often like windows of agate, and gates of carbuncle, through 
which we behold the Redeemer. Meditation puts the telescope to the 
eye, and enables us to see Jesus after a better sort than we could 
have seen him if we had lived in the days of his flesh. Would that 
our conversation were more in heaven, and that we were more taken 
up with the person, the work, the beauty of our incarnate Lord. More 
meditation, and the beauty of the King would flash upon us with more 
resplendence. Beloved, it is very probable that we shall have such 
a sight of our glorious King as we never had before, <i>when we come to die</i>. Many saints in dying have looked up from amidst the stormy waters, 
and have seen Jesus walking on the waves of the sea, and heard him 
say, “It is I, be not afraid.” Ah, yes! when the tenement begins to shake, and the clay falls away, 
we see Christ through the rifts, and between the rafters the sunlight 
of heaven comes streaming in. But if we want to see face to face the 
“King in his beauty” <i>we must go</i> <i>to heaven</i> for the sight, or the King must come here in person. O that he would 
come on the wings of the wind! He is our Husband, and we are widowed 
by his absence; he is our Brother dear and fair, and we are lonely 
without him. Thick veils and clouds hang between our souls and their 
true life: when shall the day break and the shadows flee away? Oh, 
long-expected day, begin!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1117am-p3">“To whom be glory forever.” This should be <i>the single</i> desire of the Christian. All other wishes must be subservient and 
tributary to this one. The Christian may wish for prosperity in his 
business, but only so far as it may help him to promote this—“To him be glory forever.” He may desire to attain more gifts and more graces, but it should 
only be that “To him may be glory forever.” You are not acting as you ought to do when you are moved by any other 
motive than a single eye to your Lord’s glory. As a Christian, you are “of God, and through God,” then live “to God.” Let nothing ever set your heart beating so mightily as love to him. 
Let this ambition fire your soul; be this the foundation of every 
enterprise upon which you enter, and this your sustaining motive whenever 
your zeal would grow chill; make God your only object. Depend upon 
it, where self begins sorrow begins; but if God be my supreme delight

<p class="normal" id="d1117am-p4">Let your desire for God’s glory be a <i>growing</i> desire. You blessed him in your youth, do not be content with such 
praises as you gave him then. Has God prospered you in business? Give 
him more as he has given you more. Has God given you experience? Praise 
him by stronger faith than you exercised at first. Does your knowledge 
grow? Then sing more sweetly. Do you enjoy happier times than you 
once had? Have you been restored from sickness, and has your sorrow 
been turned into peace and joy? Then give him more music; put more 
coals and more sweet frankincense into the censer of your praise. 
Practically in your life give him honour, putting the “Amen” to this doxology to your great and gracious Lord, by your own individual 
service and increasing holiness.</p>

business, and a splinter from a tree has often killed the woodman. 
Jesus is persecuted in every injured saint, and he is mighty to avenge 
his beloved ones. Success in treading down the poor and needy is a 
thing to be trembled at: if there be no danger to persecutors here 
there will be great danger hereafter.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1117pm-p4"><i>To cleave wood is a common every-day business, and yet it</i> <i>has its dangers</i>; so then, reader, there are dangers connected with your calling and 
daily life which it will be well for you to be aware of. We refer 
not to hazards by flood and field, or by disease and sudden death, 
but to perils of a spiritual sort. Your occupation may be as humble 
as log splitting, and yet the devil can tempt you in it. You may be 
a domestic servant, a farm labourer, or a mechanic, and you may be 
greatly screened from temptations to the grosser vices, and yet some 
secret sin may do you damage. Those who dwell at home, and mingle 
not with the rough world, may yet be endangered by their very seclusion. 
Nowhere is he safe who thinks himself so. Pride may enter a poor man’s heart; avarice may reign in a cottager’s bosom; uncleanness may venture into the quietest home; and anger, 
and envy, and malice may insinuate themselves into the most rural 
abode. Even in speaking a few words to a servant we may sin; a little 
purchase at a shop may be the first link in a chain of temptations; 
the mere looking out of a window may be the beginning of evil. O Lord, 
how exposed we are! How shall we be secured! To keep ourselves is 
work too hard for us: only thou thyself art able to preserve us in 
such a world of evils. Spread thy wings over us, and we, like little 
chickens, will cower down beneath thee, and feel ourselves safe!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1118am-p3">In this metaphor, which has reference to the inner life of a believer, 
we have very plainly the idea of <i>secrecy</i>. It is a spring <i>shut up</i>: just as there were springs in the East, over which an edifice was 
built, so that none could reach them save those who knew the secret 
entrance; so is the heart of a believer when it is renewed by grace: 
there is a mysterious life within which no human skill can touch. 
It is a secret which no other man knoweth; nay, which the very man 
who is the possessor of it cannot tell to his neighbour. The text 
includes not only secrecy, but <i>separation</i>. It is not the common spring, of which every passer-by may drink, 
it is one kept and preserved from all others; it is a fountain bearing 
a particular mark—a king’s royal seal, so that all can perceive that it is not a common fountain, 
but a fountain owned by a proprietor, and placed specially by itself 
alone. So is it with the spiritual life. The chosen of God were separated 
in the eternal decree; they were separated by God in the day of redemption; 
and they are separated by the possession of a life which others have 
not; and it is impossible for them to feel at home with the world, 
or to delight in its pleasures. There is also the idea of <i>sacredness</i>. The spring shut up is preserved for the use of some special person: 
and such is the Christian’s heart. It is a spring kept for Jesus. Every Christian should feel 
that he has God’s seal upon him—and he should be able to say with Paul, “From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks 
of the Lord Jesus.” Another idea is prominent—it is that of <i>security</i>. Oh! how sure and safe is the inner life of the believer! If all 
the powers of earth and hell could combine against it, that immortal 
principle must still exist, for he who gave it pledged his life for 
its preservation. And who “is he that shall harm you,” when God is your protector?</p>

forever. Jesus always <i>was</i>. The Babe born in Bethlehem was united to the Word, which was in 
the beginning, by whom all things were made. The title by which Christ 
revealed himself to John in Patmos was, “Him which is, and which was, and which is to come.” If he were not God from everlasting, we could not so devoutly love 
him; we could not feel that he had any share in the eternal love which 
is the fountain of all covenant blessings; but since he was from all 
eternity with the Father, we trace the stream of divine love to himself 
equally with his Father and the blessed Spirit. As our Lord always 
<i>was</i>, so also he is for evermore. Jesus is not dead; “He ever liveth to make intercession for us.” Resort to him in all your times of need, for he is waiting to bless 
you still. Moreover, Jesus our Lord ever <i>shall be</i>. If God should spare your life to fulfil your full day of threescore 
years and ten, you will find that his cleansing fountain is still 
opened, and his precious blood has not lost its power; you shall find 
that the Priest who filled the healing fount with his own blood, lives 
to purge you from all iniquity. When only your last battle remains 
to be fought, you shall find that the hand of your conquering Captain 
has not grown feeble—the living Saviour shall cheer the dying saint. When you enter heaven 
you shall find him there bearing the dew of his youth; and through 
eternity the Lord Jesus shall still remain the perennial spring of 
joy, and life, and glory to his people. Living waters may you draw 
from this sacred well! Jesus always was, he always is, he always shall 
be. He is eternal in all his attributes, in all his offices, in all 
his might, and willingness to bless, comfort, guard, and crown his 
chosen people.</p>

disputing over matters which are, at best, of minor importance. The 
old schoolmen did a world of mischief by their incessant discussion 
of subjects of no practical importance; and our Churches suffer much 
from petty wars over abstruse points and unimportant questions. After 
everything has been said that can be said, neither party is any the 
wiser, and therefore the discussion no more promotes knowledge than 
love, and it is foolish to sow in so barren a field. Questions upon 
points wherein Scripture is silent; upon mysteries which belong to 
God alone; upon prophecies of doubtful interpretation; and upon mere 
modes of observing human ceremonials, are all foolish, and wise men 
avoid them. Our business is neither to ask nor answer foolish questions, 
but to avoid them altogether; and if we observe the apostle’s precept (<scripRef passage="Tit 3:8" id="d1119am-p3.1" parsed="|Titus|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Titus.3.8">Titus 3:8</scripRef>) to be careful to maintain good works, we shall find ourselves far

unworthy, contentious, and needless strivings.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1119am-p4">There are, however, some questions which are the reverse of foolish, 
which we must not avoid, but fairly and honestly meet, such as these: 
Do I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? Am I renewed in the spirit 
of my mind? Am I walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit? 
Am I growing in grace? Does my conversation adorn the doctrine of 
God my Saviour? Am I looking for the coming of the Lord, and watching 
as a servant should do who expects his master? What more can I do 
for Jesus? Such enquiries as these urgently demand our attention; 
and if we have been at all given to cavilling, let us now turn our 
critical abilities to a service so much more profitable. Let us be 
peace-makers, and endeavour to lead others both by our precept and 
example, to “avoid foolish questions.”</p>

of an afflicted child of God is once more to see his Father’s face. His first prayer is not “O that I might be healed of the disease which now festers in every 
part of my body!” nor even “O that I might see my children restored from the jaws of the grave, 
and my property once more brought from the hand of the spoiler!” but the first and uppermost cry is, “O that I knew where I might find <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1119pm-p3.1">Him</span>, who is my God! that I might come even to his seat!” God’s children run home when the storm comes on. It is the heaven-born 
instinct of a gracious soul to seek shelter from all ills beneath 
the wings of Jehovah. “He that hath made his refuge God,” might serve as the title of a true believer. A hypocrite, when afflicted 
by God, resents the infliction, and, like a slave, would run from 
the Master who has scourged him; but not so the true heir of heaven, 
he kisses the hand which smote him, and seeks shelter from the rod 
in the bosom of the God who frowned upon him. Job’s desire to commune with God was intensified by the failure of all 
other sources of consolation. The patriarch turned away from his sorry 
friends, and looked up to the celestial throne, just as a traveller 
turns from his empty skin bottle, and betakes himself with all speed 
to the well. He bids farewell to earth-born hopes, and cries, “O that I knew where I might find my God!” Nothing teaches us so much the preciousness of the Creator, as when 
we learn the emptiness of all besides. Turning away with bitter scorn 
from earth’s hives, where we find no honey, but many sharp stings, we rejoice 
in him whose faithful word is sweeter than honey or the honeycomb. 
In every trouble we should first seek to realize God’s presence with us. Only let us enjoy his smile, and we can bear our 
daily cross with a willing heart for his dear sake.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1120am-p3">Observe how <i>positively</i> the prophet speaks. He doth not say, “I hope, I trust, I sometimes think, that God hath pleaded the causes 
of my soul;” but he speaks of it as a matter of fact not to be disputed. “Thou <i>hast</i> pleaded the causes of my soul.” Let us, by the aid of the gracious Comforter, shake off those doubts 
and fears which so much mar our peace and comfort. Be this our prayer, 
that we may have done with the harsh croaking voice of surmise and 
suspicion, and may be able to speak with the clear, melodious voice 
of full assurance. Notice how <i>gratefully</i> the prophet speaks, ascribing all the glory to God alone! You perceive 
there is not a word concerning himself or his own pleadings. He doth 
not ascribe his deliverance in any measure to any man, much less to 
his own merit; but it is “<i>thou</i>”—“O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; <i>thou</i> hast redeemed my life.” A grateful spirit should ever be cultivated by the Christian; and 
especially after deliverances we should prepare a song for our God. 
Earth should be a temple filled with the songs of grateful saints, 
and every day should be a censor smoking with the sweet incense of 
thanksgiving. How <i>joyful</i> Jeremiah seems to be while he records the Lord’s mercy. How triumphantly he lifts up the strain! He has been in the 
low dungeon, and is even now no other than the weeping prophet; and 
yet in the very book which is called “Lamentations,” clear as the song of Miriam when she dashed her fingers against the 
tabor, shrill as the note of Deborah when she met Barak with shouts 
of victory, we hear the voice of Jeremy going up to heaven—“Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.” O children of God, seek after a vital experience of the Lord’s lovingkindness, and when you have it, speak positively of it; sing 
gratefully; shout triumphantly.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1120pm-p3">Conscious of their own natural defencelessness, the conies resort 
to burrows in the rocks, and are secure from their enemies. My heart, 
be willing to gather a lesson from these feeble folk. Thou art as 
weak and as exposed to peril as the timid cony; be as wise to seek 
a shelter. My best security is within the munitions of an immutable 
Jehovah, where his unalterable promises stand like giant walls of 
rock. It will be well with thee, my heart, if thou canst always hide 
thyself in the bulwarks of his glorious attributes, all of which are 
guarantees of safety for those who put their trust in him. Blessed 
be the name of the Lord, I have so done, and have found myself like 
David in Adullam, safe from the cruelty of my enemy; I have not now 
to find out the blessedness of the man who puts his trust in the Lord, 
for long ago, when Satan and my sins pursued me, I fled to the cleft 
of the rock Christ Jesus, and in his riven side I found a delightful 
resting-place. My heart, run to him anew tonight, whatever thy present 
grief may be; Jesus feels for thee; Jesus consoles thee; Jesus will 
help thee. No monarch in his impregnable fortress is more secure than 
the cony in his rocky burrow. The master of ten thousand chariots 
is not one whit better protected than the little dweller in the mountain’s cleft. In Jesus the weak are strong, and the defenceless safe; they 
could not be more strong if they were giants, or more safe if they 
were in heaven. Faith gives to men on earth the protection of the 
God of heaven. More they cannot need, and need not wish. The conies 
cannot build a castle, but they avail themselves of what is there 
already: I cannot make myself a refuge, but Jesus has provided it, 
his Father has given it, his Spirit has revealed it, and lo, again 
tonight I enter it, and am safe from every foe.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1121am-p3">All that the believer has must come from Christ, but it comes solely 
through the channel of the Spirit of grace. Moreover, as all blessings 
thus flow to you through the Holy Spirit, so also no good thing can 
come out of you in holy thought, devout worship, or gracious act, 
apart from the sanctifying operation of the same Spirit. Even if the 
good seed be sown in you, yet it lies dormant except he worketh in 
you to will and to do of his own good pleasure. Do you desire to speak 
for Jesus—how can you unless the Holy Ghost touch your tongue? Do you desire 
to pray? Alas! what dull work it is unless the Spirit maketh intercession 
for you! Do you desire to subdue sin? Would you be holy? Would you 
imitate your Master? Do you desire to rise to superlative heights 
of spirituality? Are you wanting to be made like the angels of God, 
full of zeal and ardour for the Master’s cause? You cannot without the Spirit—“Without me ye can do nothing.” O branch of the vine, thou canst have no fruit without the sap! O 
child of God, thou hast no life within thee apart from the life which 
God gives thee through his Spirit! Then let us not grieve him or provoke 
him to anger by our sin. Let us not quench him in one of his faintest 
motions in our soul; let us foster every suggestion, and be ready 
to obey every prompting. If the Holy Spirit be indeed so mighty, let 
us attempt nothing without him; let us begin no project, and carry 
on no enterprise, and conclude no transaction, without imploring his 
blessing. Let us do him the due homage of feeling our entire weakness 
apart from him, and then depending alone upon him, having this for 
our prayer, “Open thou my heart and my whole being to thine incoming, and uphold 
me with thy free Spirit when I shall have received that Spirit in 
my inward parts.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1121pm-p3"><i>He is to be envied</i>. It was well to be Martha and serve, but better to be Lazarus and 
commune. There are times for each purpose, and each is comely in its 
season, but none of the trees of the garden yield such clusters as 
the vine of fellowship. To sit with Jesus, to hear his words, to mark 
his acts, and receive his smiles, was such a favour as must have made 
Lazarus as happy as the angels. When it has been our happy lot to 
feast with our Beloved in his banqueting-hall, we would not have given 
half a sigh for all the kingdoms of the world, if so much breath could 
have bought them.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1121pm-p4"><i>He is to be imitated</i>. It would have been a strange thing if Lazarus had not been at the 
table where Jesus was, for he had been dead, and Jesus had raised 
him. For the risen one to be absent when the Lord who gave him life 
was at his house, would have been ungrateful indeed. We too were once 
dead, yea, and like Lazarus stinking in the grave of sin; Jesus raised 
us, and by his life we live—can we be content to live at a distance from him? Do we omit to remember 
him at his table, where he deigns to feast with his brethren? Oh, 
this is cruel! It behoves us to repent, and do as <i>he</i> has bidden us, for his least wish should be law to us. To have lived 
without constant intercourse with one of whom the Jews said, “Behold how he loved him,” would have been disgraceful to Lazarus; is it excusable in us whom 
Jesus has loved with an everlasting love? To have been cold to him 
who wept over his lifeless corpse, would have argued great brutishness 
in Lazarus. What does it argue in us over whom the Saviour has not 
only wept, but bled? Come, brethren, who read this portion, let us 
return unto our heavenly Bridegroom, and ask for his Spirit that we 
may be on terms of closer intimacy with him, and henceforth sit at 
the table with him.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1122am-p3">Jacob, while expostulating with Laban, thus describes his own toil, 
“This twenty years have I been with thee. That which was torn of beasts 
I brought not unto thee: I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou 
require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. Thus I was; 
in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my 
sleep departed from mine eyes.” Even more toilsome than this was the life of our Saviour here below. 
He watched over all his sheep till he gave in as his last account, 
“Of all those whom thou hast given me I have lost none.” His hair was wet with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night. 
Sleep departed from his eyes, for all night he was in prayer wrestling 
for his people. One night Peter must be pleaded for; anon, another 
claims his tearful intercession. No shepherd sitting beneath the cold 
skies, looking up to the stars, could ever utter such complaints because 
of the hardness of his toil as Jesus Christ might have brought, if 
he had chosen to do so, because of the sternness of his service in 
order to procure his spouse—</p>
<verse id="d1122am-p3.1">
  <l class="t1" id="d1122am-p3.2">“Cold mountains and the midnight air,</l>

<p class="normal" id="d1122am-p4">It is sweet to dwell upon the spiritual parallel of Laban having required 
all the sheep at Jacob’s hand. If they were torn of beasts, Jacob must make it good; if any 
of them died, he must stand as surety for the whole. Was not the toil 
of Jesus for his Church the toil of one who was under suretiship obligations 
to bring every believing one safe to the hand of him who had committed 
them to his charge? Look upon toiling Jacob, and you see a representation 
of him of whom we read, “He shall feed his flock like a shepherd.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1122pm-p3">The doctrine of a risen Saviour is exceedingly precious. The resurrection 
is the corner-stone of the entire building of Christianity. It is 
the key-stone of the arch of our salvation. It would take a volume 
to set forth all the streams of living water which flow from this 
one sacred source, the resurrection of our dear Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ; but <i>to know</i> that he has risen, and to have fellowship with him as such—communing with the risen Saviour by possessing a risen life—seeing him leave the tomb by leaving the tomb of worldliness ourselves, 
this is even still more precious. The doctrine is the basis of the 
experience, but as the flower is more lovely than the root, so is 
the experience of fellowship with the risen Saviour more lovely than 
the doctrine itself. I would have you <i>believe</i> that Christ rose from the dead so as to sing of it, and derive all 
the consolation which it is possible for you to extract from this 
well-ascertained and well-witnessed fact; but I beseech you, rest 
not contented even there. Though you cannot, like the disciples, see 
him visibly, yet I bid you aspire to see Christ Jesus by the eye of 
faith; and though, like Mary Magdalene, you may not “touch” him, yet may you be privileged to converse with him, and to know 
that he is risen, you yourselves being risen in him to newness of 
life. To know a crucified Saviour as having crucified all my sins, 
is a high degree of knowledge; but to know a risen Saviour as having 
justified me, and to realize that he has bestowed upon me new life, 
having given me to be a new creature through his own newness of life, 
this is a noble style of experience: short of it, none ought to rest 
satisfied. May you both “know him, and the power of his resurrection.” Why should souls who are quickened with Jesus, wear the grave-clothes 
of worldliness and unbelief? Rise, for the Lord is risen.</p>

complete fellowship with him, that we were made one with him, and 
his interests and ours became mutual and identical. We have fellowship 
with Christ in his <i>love</i>. What he loves we love. He loves the saints—so do we. He loves sinners—so do we. He loves the poor perishing race of man, and pants to see 
earth’s deserts transformed into the garden of the Lord—so do we. We have fellowship with him in his <i>desires</i>. He desires the glory of God—we also labour for the same. He desires that the saints may be with 
him where he is—we desire to be with him there too. He desires to drive out sin—behold we fight under his banner. He desires that his Father’s name may be loved and adored by all his creatures—we pray daily, “Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, even as it is in 
heaven.” We have fellowship with Christ in his <i>sufferings</i>. We are not nailed to the cross, nor do we die a cruel death, but 
when he is reproached, we are reproached; and a very sweet thing it 
is to be blamed for his sake, to be despised for following the Master, 
to have the world against us. The disciple should not be above his 
Lord. In our measure we commune with him in his <i>labours</i>, ministering to men by the word of truth and by deeds of love. Our 
meat and our drink, like his, is to do the will of him who hath sent 
us and to finish his work. We have also fellowship with Christ in 
his <i>joys</i>. We are happy in his happiness, we rejoice in his exaltation. Have 
you ever tasted that joy, believer? There is no purer or more thrilling 
delight to be known this side heaven than that of having Christ’s joy fulfilled in us, that our joy may be full. His <i>glory</i> awaits us to complete our fellowship, for his Church shall sit with 
him upon his throne, as his well-beloved bride and queen.</p>

Places near broad rivers are remarkable for the variety of their plants 
and their plentiful harvests. God is all this to his Church. Having 
God she has <i>abundance</i>. What can she ask for that he will not give her? What want can she 
mention which he will not supply? “In this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all people a feast 
of fat things.” Want ye the bread of life? It drops like manna from the sky. Want 
ye refreshing streams? The rock follows you, and that Rock is Christ. 
If you suffer any want it is your own fault; if you are straitened 
you are not straitened in him, but in your own bowels. Broad rivers 
and streams also point to <i>commerce</i>. Our glorious Lord is to us a place of heavenly merchandise. Through 
our Redeemer we have commerce with the past; the wealth of Calvary, 
the treasures of the covenant, the riches of the ancient days of election, 
the stores of eternity, all come to us down the broad stream of our 
gracious Lord. We have commerce, too, with the future. What galleys, 
laden to the water’s edge, come to us from the millennium! What visions we have of the 
days of heaven upon earth! Through our glorious Lord we have commerce 
with angels; communion with the bright spirits washed in blood, who 
sing before the throne; nay, better still, we have fellowship with 
the Infinite One. Broad rivers and streams are specially intended 
to set forth the idea of <i>security</i>. Rivers were of old a defence. Oh! beloved, what a defence is God 
to his Church! The devil cannot cross this broad river of God. How 
he wishes he could turn the current, but fear not, for God abideth 
immutably the same. Satan may worry, but he cannot destroy us; no 
galley with oars shall invade our river, neither shall gallant ship 
pass thereby.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1124pm-p3">The worst of sluggards only ask for a little slumber; they would be 
indignant if they were accused of thorough idleness. A little folding 
of the hands to sleep is all they crave, and they have a crowd of 
reasons to show that this indulgence is a very proper one. Yet by 
these littles the day ebbs out, and the time for labour is all gone, 
and the field is grown over with thorns. It is by little procrastinations 
that men ruin their souls. They have no intention to delay for years—a few months will bring the more convenient season—to-morrow if you will, they will attend to serious things; but the 
present hour is so occupied and altogether so unsuitable, that they 
beg to be excused. Like sands from an hour-glass, time passes, life 
is wasted by driblets, and seasons of grace lost by little slumbers. 
Oh, to be wise, to catch the flying hour, to use the moments on the 
wing! May the Lord teach us this sacred wisdom, for otherwise a poverty 
of the worst sort awaits us, eternal poverty which shall want even 
a drop of water, and beg for it in vain. Like a traveller steadily 
pursuing his journey, poverty overtakes the slothful, and ruin overthrows 
the undecided: each hour brings the dreaded pursuer nearer; he pauses 
not by the way, for he is on his master’s business and must not tarry. As an armed man enters with authority 
and power, so shall want come to the idle, and death to the impenitent, 
and there will be no escape. O that men were wise be-times, and would 
seek diligently unto the Lord Jesus, or ere the solemn day shall dawn 
when it will be too late to plough and to sow, too late to repent 
and believe. In harvest, it is vain to lament that the seed time was 
neglected. As yet, faith and holy decision are timely. May we obtain 
them this night.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1125am-p3">None but Jesus can give deliverance to captives. Real liberty cometh 
from him only. It is a liberty <i>righteously bestowed</i>; for the Son, who is Heir of all things, has a right to make men 
free. The saints honour the justice of God, which now secures their 
salvation. It is a liberty which has been <i>dearly</i> <i>purchased</i>. Christ speaks it by his power, but he bought it by his blood. He 
makes thee free, but it is by his own bonds. Thou goest clear, because 
he bare thy burden for thee: thou art set at liberty, because he has 
suffered in thy stead. But, though dearly purchased, <i>he freely gives it</i>. Jesus asks nothing of us as a preparation for this liberty. He finds 
us sitting in sackcloth and ashes, and bids us put on the beautiful 
array of freedom; he saves us just as we are, and all without our 
help or merit. When Jesus sets free, the liberty is <i>perpetually entailed</i>; no chains can bind again. Let the Master say to me, “Captive, I have delivered thee,” and it is done forever. Satan may plot to enslave us, but if the 
Lord be on our side, whom shall we fear? The world, with its temptations, 
may seek to ensnare us, but mightier is he who is for us than all 
they who be against us. The machinations of our own deceitful hearts 
may harass and annoy us, but he who hath begun the good work in us 
will carry it on and perfect it to the end. The foes of God and the 
enemies of man may gather their hosts together, and come with concentrated 
fury against us, but if God acquitteth, who is he that condemneth? 
Not more free is the eagle which mounts to his rocky eyrie, and afterwards 
outsoars the clouds, than the soul which Christ hath delivered. If 
we are no more under the law, but free from its curse, let our liberty 
be <i>practically exhibited</i> in our serving God with gratitude and delight. “I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed 
my bonds.” “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1125pm-p3">In these words the Lord in the plainest manner claims the right to 
give or to withhold his mercy according to his own sovereign will. 
As the prerogative of life and death is vested in the monarch, so 
the Judge of all the earth has a right to spare or condemn the guilty, 
as may seem best in his sight. Men by their sins have forfeited all 
claim upon God; they deserve to perish for their sins—and if they all do so, they have no ground for complaint. If the Lord 
steps in to save any, he may do so if the ends of justice are not 
thwarted; but if he judges it best to leave the condemned to suffer 
the righteous sentence, none may arraign him at their bar. Foolish 
and impudent are all those discourses about the rights of men to be 
all placed on the same footing; ignorant, if not worse, are those 
contentions against discriminating grace, which are but the rebellions 
of proud human nature against the crown and sceptre of Jehovah. When 
we are brought to see our own utter ruin and ill desert, and the justice 
of the divine verdict against sin, we no longer cavil at the truth 
that the Lord is not bound to save us; we do not murmur if he chooses 
to save others, as though he were doing us an injury, but feel that 
if he deigns to look upon us, it will be his own free act of undeserved 
goodness, for which we shall forever bless his name.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1125pm-p4">How shall those who are the subjects of divine election sufficiently 
adore the grace of God? They have no room for boasting, for sovereignty 
most effectually excludes it. The Lord’s will alone is glorified, and the very notion of human merit is cast 
out to everlasting contempt. There is no more humbling doctrine in 
Scripture than that of election, none more promotive of gratitude, 
and, consequently, none more sanctifying. Believers should not be 
afraid of it, but adoringly rejoice in it.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1126am-p3">“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,” refers to works that are <i>possible</i>. There are many things which our heart findeth to do which we never 
shall do. It is well it is in our heart; but if we would be eminently 
useful, we must not be content with forming schemes in our heart, 
and talking of them; we must practically carry out “<i>whatsoever our hand findeth to do</i>.” One good deed is more worth than a thousand brilliant theories. Let 
us not wait for large opportunities, or for a different kind of work, 
but do just the things we “find to do” day by day. We have no other time in which to live. The past is gone; 
the future has not arrived; we never shall have any time but time 
present. Then do not wait until your experience has ripened into maturity 
before you attempt to serve God. Endeavour now to bring forth fruit. 
Serve God now, but be careful as to the way in which you perform what 
you find to do—“<i>do it with thy</i> <i>might</i>.” Do it <i>promptly</i>; do not fritter away your life in thinking of what you intend to 
do to-morrow as if that could recompense for the idleness of today. 
No man ever served God by doing things to-morrow. If we honour Christ 
and are blessed, it is by the things which we do <i>today</i>. Whatever you do for Christ throw your whole soul into it. Do not 
give Christ a little slurred labour, done as a matter of course now 
and then; but when you do serve him, do it with heart, and soul, and 
strength.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1126am-p4">But where is the might of a Christian? It is not in himself, for he 
is perfect weakness. His might lieth in the Lord of Hosts. Then let 
us seek his help; let us proceed with prayer and faith, and when we 
have done what our “hand findeth to do,” let us wait upon the Lord for his blessing. What we do thus will 
be well done, and will not fail in its effect.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1126pm-p3">Small things marked the beginning of the work in the hand of Zerubbabel, 
but none might despise it, for the Lord had raised up one who would 
persevere until the headstone should be brought forth with shoutings. 
The plummet was in good hands. Here is the comfort of every believer 
in the Lord Jesus; let the work of grace be ever so small in its beginnings, 
<i>the plummet is in</i> <i>good hands</i>, a master builder greater than Solomon has undertaken the raising 
of the heavenly temple, and he will not fail nor be discouraged till the topmost pinnacle shall 
be raised. If the plummet were in the hand of any merely human being, 
we might fear for the building, but the pleasure of the Lord shall 
prosper in Jesus’ hand. The works did not proceed irregularly, and without care, for 
<i>the master’s hand carried a</i> <i>good instrument</i>. Had the walls been hurriedly run up without due superintendence, 
they might have been out of the perpendicular; but the plummet was 
used by the chosen overseer. Jesus is evermore watching the erection 
of his spiritual temple, that it may be built securely and well. We 
are for haste, but Jesus is for judgment. He will use the plummet, 
and that which is out of line must come down, every stone of it. Hence 
the failure of many a flattering work, the overthrow of many a glittering 
profession. It is not for us to judge the Lord’s church, since Jesus has a steady hand, and a true eye, and can use 
the plummet well. Do we not rejoice to see judgment left to him?</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1126pm-p4"><i>The plummet was in active use</i>—it was in the builder’s hand; a sure indication that he meant to push on the work to completion. 
O Lord Jesus, how would we indeed be glad if we could see thee at 
thy great work. O Zion, the beautiful, thy walls are still in ruins! 
Rise, thou glorious Builder, and make her desolations to rejoice at 
thy coming.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1127am-p3">In Joshua <i>the high priest</i> we see a picture of each and every child of God, who has been made 
nigh by the blood of Christ, and has been taught to minister in holy 
things, and enter into that which is within the veil. Jesus has made 
us priests and kings unto God, and even here upon earth we exercise 
the priesthood of consecrated living and hallowed service. But this 
high priest is said to be “<i>standing</i> before the angel of the Lord,” that is, standing to minister. This should be the perpetual position 
of every true believer. Every place is now God’s temple, and his people can as truly serve him in their daily employments 
as in his house. They are to be always “ministering,” offering the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, and presenting 
themselves a “living sacrifice.” But notice where it is that Joshua stands to minister, it is <i>before the angel</i> of Jehovah. It is only through a mediator that we poor defiled ones 
can ever become priests unto God. I present what I have before the 
messenger, the angel of the covenant, the Lord Jesus; and through 
him my prayers find acceptance wrapped up in his prayers; my praises 
become sweet as they are bound up with bundles of myrrh, and aloes, 
and cassia from Christ’s own garden. If I can bring him nothing but my tears, he will put 
them with his own tears in his own bottle for he once wept; if I can 
bring him nothing but my groans and sighs, he will accept these as 
an acceptable sacrifice, for he once was broken in heart, and sighed 
heavily in spirit. I myself, standing in him, am accepted in the Beloved; 
and all my polluted works, though in themselves only objects of divine 
abhorrence, are so received, that God smelleth a sweet savour. He 
is content and I am blessed. See, then, the position of the Christian—“a priest—standing—before the angel of the Lord.”</p>

Blessed, forever blessed be that dear star of pardon which shines 
into the condemned cell, and gives the perishing a gleam of hope amid 
the midnight of despair! Can it be possible that sin, such sin as 
mine, can be forgiven, forgiven altogether, and forever? Hell is my 
portion as a sinner—there is no possibility of my escaping from it while sin remains upon 
me—can the load of guilt be uplifted, the crimson stain removed? Can 
the adamantine stones of my prison-house ever be loosed from their 
mortices, or the doors be lifted from their hinges? Jesus tells me 
that I may yet be clear. Forever blessed be the revelation of atoning 
love which not only tells me that pardon is possible, but that it 
is secured to all who rest in Jesus. I have believed in the appointed 
propitiation, even Jesus crucified, and therefore my sins are at this 
moment, and forever, forgiven by virtue of his substitutionary pains 
and death. What joy is this! What bliss to be a perfectly pardoned 
soul! My soul dedicates all her powers to him who of his own unpurchased 
love became my surety, and wrought out for me redemption through his 
blood. What riches of grace does free forgiveness exhibit! To forgive 
at all, to forgive fully, to forgive freely, to forgive forever! Here 
is a constellation of wonders; and when I think of how great my sins 
were, how dear were the precious drops which cleansed me from them, 
and how gracious was the method by which pardon was sealed home to 
me, I am in a maze of wondering worshipping affection. I bow before 
the throne which absolves me, I clasp the cross which delivers me, 
I serve henceforth all my days the Incarnate God, through whom I am 
this night a pardoned soul.</p>

had not been the case, the second could never have occurred; and if 
the second could not be said of him the first would have been a mere 
pretence. Truth must enter into the soul, penetrate and saturate it, 
or else it is of no value. Doctrines held as a matter of creed are 
like bread in the hand, which ministers no nourishment to the frame; 
but doctrine accepted by the heart, is as food digested, which, by 
assimilation, sustains and builds up the body. In us truth must be 
a living force, an active energy, an indwelling reality, a part of 
the woof and warp of our being. If it be <i>in us</i>, we cannot henceforth part with it. A man may lose his garments or 
his limbs, but his inward parts are vital, and cannot be torn away 
without absolute loss of life. A Christian can die, but he cannot 
deny the truth. Now it is a rule of nature that the inward affects 
the outward, as light shines from the centre of the lantern through 
the glass: when, therefore, the truth is kindled within, its brightness 
soon beams forth in the outward life and conversation. It is said 
that the food of certain worms colours the cocoons of silk which they 
spin: and just so the nutriment upon which a man’s inward nature lives gives a tinge to every word and deed proceeding 
from him. To walk in the truth, imports a life of integrity, holiness, 
faithfulness, and simplicity—the natural product of those principles of truth which the gospel 
teaches, and which the Spirit of God enables us to receive. We may 
judge of the secrets of the soul by their manifestation in the man’s conversation. Be it ours today, O gracious Spirit, to be ruled and 
governed by thy divine authority, so that nothing false or sinful 
may reign in our hearts, lest it extend its malignant influence to 
our daily walk among men.</p>

glory, seeks not his own, but spends his power for his people. It 
were well if every Christian would be a Mordecai to the church, striving 
according to his ability for its prosperity. Some are placed in stations 
of affluence and influence, let them honour their Lord in the high 
places of the earth, and testify for Jesus before great men. Others 
have what is far better, namely, close fellowship with the King of 
kings, let them be sure to plead daily for the weak of the Lord’s people, the doubting, the tempted, and the comfortless. It will 
redound to their honour if they make much intercession for those who 
are in darkness and dare not draw nigh unto the mercy seat. Instructed 
believers may serve their Master greatly if they lay out their talents 
for the general good, and impart their wealth of heavenly learning 
to others, by teaching them the things of God. The very least in our 
Israel may at least <i>seek</i> the welfare of his people; and his desire, if he can give no more, 
shall be acceptable. It is at once the most Christlike and the most 
happy course for a believer to cease from living to himself. He who

<p class="normal" id="d1129am-p3">Tale-bearing emits a threefold poison; for it injures the teller, 
the hearer, and the person concerning whom the tale is told. Whether 
the report be true or false, we are by this precept of God’s Word forbidden to spread it. The reputations of the Lord’s people should be very precious in our sight, and we should count 
it shame to help the devil to dishonour the Church and the name of 
the Lord. Some tongues need a bridle rather than a spur. Many glory 
in pulling down their brethren, as if thereby they raised themselves. 
Noah’s wise sons cast a mantle over their father, and he who exposed him 
earned a fearful curse. We may ourselves one of these dark days need 
forbearance and silence from our brethren, let us render it cheerfully 
to those who require it now. Be this our family rule, and our personal 
bond—<span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1129am-p3.1">Speak evil of no man</span>.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1129am-p4">The Holy Spirit, however, permits us to censure sin, and prescribes 
the way in which we are to do it. It must be done by rebuking our 
brother to his face, not by railing behind his back. This course is 
manly, brotherly, Christlike, and under God’s blessing will be useful. Does the flesh shrink from it? Then we 
must lay the greater stress upon our conscience, and keep ourselves 
to the work, lest by suffering sin upon our friend we become ourselves 
partakers of it. Hundreds have been saved from gross sins by the timely, 
wise, affectionate warnings of faithful ministers and brethren. Our 
Lord Jesus has set us a gracious example of how to deal with erring 
friends in his warning given to Peter, the prayer with which he preceded 
it, and the gentle way in which he bore with Peter’s boastful denial that he needed such a caution.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1129pm-p3">Much use was made of this anointing oil under the law, and that which 
it represents is of primary importance under the gospel. The Holy 
Spirit, who anoints us for all holy service, is indispensable to us 
if we would serve the Lord acceptably. Without his aid our religious 
services are but a vain oblation, and our inward experience is a dead 
thing. Whenever our ministry is without unction, what miserable stuff 
it becomes! nor are the prayers, praises, meditations, and efforts 
of private Christians one jot superior. A holy anointing is the soul 
and life of piety, its absence the most grievous of all calamities. 
To go before the Lord without anointing is as though some common Levite 
had thrust himself into the priest’s office—his ministrations would rather have been sins than services. May we 
never venture upon hallowed exercises without sacred anointings. They 
drop upon us from our glorious Head; from his anointing we who are 
as the skirts of his garments partake of a plenteous unction. Choice 
spices were compounded with rarest art of the apothecary to form the 
anointing oil, to show forth to us how rich are all the influences 
of the Holy Spirit. All good things are found in the divine Comforter. 
Matchless consolation, infallible instruction, immortal quickening, 
spiritual energy, and divine sanctification all lie compounded with 
other excellencies in that sacred eye-salve, the heavenly anointing 
oil of the Holy Spirit. It imparts a delightful fragrance to the character 
and person of the man upon whom it is poured. Nothing like it can 
be found in all the treasuries of the rich, or the secrets of the 
wise. It is not to be imitated. It comes alone from God, and it is 
freely given, through Jesus Christ, to every waiting soul. Let us 
seek it, for we may have it, may have it this very evening. O Lord, 
anoint thy servants.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1130am-p3">A very important question this seemed to be to the king of Judah, 
and possibly it is of even more weight with the tried and tempted 
O Christian. To lose money is at no times pleasant, and when principle 
involves it, the flesh is not always ready to make the sacrifice. 
“Why lose that which may be so usefully employed? May not the truth 
itself be bought too dear? What shall we do without it? Remember the 
children, and our small income!” All these things and a thousand more would tempt the Christian to 
put forth his hand to unrighteous gain, or stay himself from carrying 
out his conscientious convictions, when they involve serious loss. 
All men cannot view these matters in the light of faith; and even 
with the followers of Jesus, the doctrine of “we must live” has quite sufficient weight.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1130am-p4"><i>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this</i> is a very satisfactory answer to the anxious question. Our Father 
holds the purse-strings, and what we lose for his sake he can repay 
a thousand-fold. It is ours to obey his will, and we may rest assured 
that he will provide for us. The Lord will be no man’s debtor at the last. Saints know that a grain of heart's-ease is 
of more value than a ton of gold. He who wraps a threadbare coat about 
a good conscience has gained a spiritual wealth far more desirable 
than any he has lost. God’s smile and a dungeon are enough for a true heart; his frown and a 
palace would be hell to a gracious spirit. Let the worst come to the 
worst, let all the talents go, we have not lost our treasure, for 
that is above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Meanwhile, 
even now, the Lord maketh the meek to inherit the earth, and no good 
thing doth he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1130pm-p3">War always will rage between the two great sovereignties until one 
or other be crushed. Peace between good and evil is an impossibility; 
the very pretence of it would, in fact, be the triumph of the powers 
of darkness. <i>Michael will always</i> <i>fight</i>; his holy soul is vexed with sin, and will not endure it. Jesus will 
always be the dragon’s foe, and that not in a quiet sense, but actively, vigorously, with 
full determination to exterminate evil. All his servants, whether 
angels in heaven or messengers on earth, will and must fight; they 
are born to be warriors—at the cross they enter into covenant never to make truce with evil; 
they are a warlike company, firm in defence and fierce in attack. 
The duty of every soldier in the army of the Lord is daily, with all 
his heart, and soul, and strength, to fight against the dragon.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1130pm-p4"><i>The dragon and his angels will not decline the affray</i>; they are incessant in their onslaughts, sparing no weapon, fair 
or foul. We are foolish to expect to serve God without opposition: 
the more zealous we are, the more sure are we to be assailed by the 
myrmidons of hell. The church may become slothful, but not so her 
great antagonist; his restless spirit never suffers the war to pause; 
he hates the woman’s seed, and would fain devour the church if he could. The servants 
of Satan partake much of the old dragon’s energy, and are usually an active race. War rages all around, and 
to dream of peace is dangerous and futile.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1130pm-p5">Glory be to God, we know the end of the war. The great dragon shall 
be cast out and forever destroyed, while Jesus and they who are with 
him shall receive the crown. Let us sharpen our swords tonight, and 
pray the Holy Spirit to nerve our arms for the conflict. Never battle 
so important, never crown so glorious. Every man to his post, ye warriors

and night, and tend to assure thee that he will also keep that glorious 
covenant which he has made with thee in the person of Christ Jesus. 
He who is true to his Word in the revolutions of the seasons of this 
poor sin-polluted world, will not prove unfaithful in his dealings 
with his own well-beloved Son.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1201am-p4">Winter in the soul is by no means a comfortable season, and if it 
be upon thee just now it will be very painful to thee: but there is 
this comfort, namely, that <i>the Lord</i> makes it. He sends the sharp blasts of adversity to nip the buds 
of expectation: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes over the once 
verdant meadows of our joy: he casteth forth his ice like morsels 
freezing the streams of our delight. He does it all, he is the great 
Winter King, and rules in the realms of frost, and therefore thou 
canst not murmur. Losses, crosses, heaviness, sickness, poverty, and 
a thousand other ills, are of the Lord’s sending, and come to us with wise design. Frosts kill noxious insects, 
and put a bound to raging diseases; they break up the clods, and sweeten 
the soil. O that such good results would always follow our winters

him, and in him find joy and peace in believing. Let us wrap ourselves 
in the warm garments of his promises, and go forth to labours which 
befit the season, for it were ill to be as the sluggard who will not 
plough by reason of the cold; for he shall beg in summer and have 
nothing.</p>

deprived of them we are ready to perish. Let us bless God for the 
eyes with which we behold the sun, for the health and strength to 
walk abroad, for the bread we eat, for the raiment we wear. Let us 
praise him that we are not cast out among the hopeless, or confined 
amongst the guilty; let us thank him for liberty, for friends, for 
family associations and comforts; let us praise him, in fact, for 
everything which we receive from his bounteous hand, for we deserve 
little, and yet are most plenteously endowed. But, beloved, the sweetest 
and the loudest note in our songs of praise should be of <i>redeeming love</i>. God’s redeeming acts towards his chosen are forever the favourite themes 
of their praise. If we know what redemption means, let us not withhold 
our sonnets of thanksgiving. We have been redeemed from the power 
of our corruptions, uplifted from the depth of sin in which we were 
naturally plunged. We have been led to the cross of Christ—our shackles of guilt have been broken off; we are no longer slaves, 
but children of the living God, and can antedate the period when we 
shall be presented before the throne without spot or wrinkle or any 
such thing. Even now by faith we wave the palm-branch and wrap ourselves 
about with the fair linen which is to be our everlasting array, and 
shall we not unceasingly give thanks to the Lord our Redeemer? Child 
of God, canst thou be silent? Awake, awake, ye inheritors of glory, 
and lead your captivity captive, as ye cry with David, “Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy

of her beauty is very glowing. She is not merely <i>fair</i>, but “<i>all</i> fair.” He views her in himself, washed in his sin-atoning blood and clothed 
in his meritorious righteousness, and he considers her to be full 
of comeliness and beauty. No wonder that such is the case, since it 
is but his own perfect excellency that he admires; for the holiness, 
glory, and perfection of his Church are his own glorious garments 
on the back of his own well-beloved spouse. She is not simply pure, 
or well-proportioned; she is positively lovely and fair! She has actual 
merit! Her deformities of sin are removed; but more, she has through 
her Lord obtained a meritorious righteousness by which an actual beauty 
is conferred upon her. Believers have a positive righteousness given 
to them when they become “accepted in the beloved” (<scripRef passage="Eph 1:6" id="d1202am-p3.1" parsed="|Eph|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.1.6">Eph. 1:6</scripRef>). Nor is the Church barely lovely, she is <i>superlatively</i> so. Her Lord styles her “Thou fairest among women.” She has a real worth and excellence which cannot be rivalled by all 
the nobility and royalty of the world. If Jesus could exchange his 
elect bride for all the queens and empresses of earth, or even for 
the angels in heaven, he would not, for he puts her first and foremost—“fairest among women.” Like the moon she far outshines the stars. Nor is this an opinion 
which he is ashamed of, for he invites all men to hear it. He sets 
a “behold” before it, a special note of exclamation, inviting and arresting 
attention. “<i>Behold</i>, thou art fair, my love; <i>behold</i>, thou art fair” (<scripRef passage="Song 4:1" id="d1202am-p3.2" parsed="|Song|4|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.4.1">Song of Sol. 4:1</scripRef>). His opinion he publishes abroad even now, and one day from the

<p class="normal" id="d1202pm-p3">Nothing can satisfy the entire man but the Lord’s love and the Lord’s own self. Saints have tried to anchor in other roadsteads, but they 
have been driven out of such fatal refuges. Solomon, the wisest of 
men, was permitted to make experiments for us all, and to do for us 
what we must not dare to do for ourselves. Here is his testimony in 
his own words: “So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in 
Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes 
desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; 
for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of 
all my labour. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, 
and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was 
vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.” “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” What! the whole of it vanity? O favoured monarch, is there nothing 
in all thy wealth? Nothing in that wide dominion reaching from the 
river even to the sea? Nothing in Palmyra’s glorious palaces? Nothing in the house of the forest of Lebanon? 
In all thy music and dancing, and wine and luxury, is there nothing? 
“Nothing,” he says, “but weariness of spirit.” This was his verdict when he had trodden the whole round of pleasure. 
To embrace our Lord Jesus, to dwell in his love, and be fully assured 
of union with him—this is all in all. Dear reader, you need not try other forms of life 
in order to see whether they are better than the Christian's: if you 
roam the world around, you will see no sights like a sight of the 
Saviour’s face; if you could have all the comforts of life, if you lost your 
Saviour, you would be wretched; but if you win Christ, then should 
you rot in a dungeon, you would find it a paradise; should you live 
in obscurity, or die with famine, you will yet be satisfied with favour 
and full of the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1203am-p3">Having pronounced his Church positively full of beauty, our Lord confirms 
his praise by a precious negative, “There is no spot in thee.” As if the thought occurred to the Bridegroom that the carping world 
would insinuate that he had only mentioned her comely parts, and had 
purposely omitted those features which were deformed or defiled, he 
sums up all by declaring her universally and entirely fair, and utterly 
devoid of stain. A spot may soon be removed, and is the very least 
thing that can disfigure beauty, but even from this little blemish 
the believer is delivered in his Lord’s sight. If he had said there is no hideous scar, no horrible deformity, 
no deadly ulcer, we might even then have marvelled; but when he testifies 
that she is free from the slightest spot, all these other forms of 
defilement are included, and the depth of wonder is increased. If 
he had but promised to remove all spots by-and-by, we should have 
had eternal reason for joy; but when he speaks of it as already done, 
who can restrain the most intense emotions of satisfaction and delight? 
O my soul, here is marrow and fatness for thee; eat thy full, and 
be satisfied with royal dainties.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1203am-p4">Christ Jesus has no quarrel with his spouse. She often wanders from 
him, and grieves his Holy Spirit, but he does not allow her faults 
to affect his love. He sometimes chides, but it is always in the tenderest 
manner, with the kindest intentions: it is “my love” even then. There is no remembrance of our follies, he does not cherish 
ill thoughts of us, but he pardons and loves as well after the offence 
as before it. It is well for us it is so, for if Jesus were as mindful 
of injuries as we are, how could he commune with us? Many a time a 
believer will put himself out of humour with the Lord for some slight 
turn in providence, but our precious Husband knows our silly hearts 
too well to take any offence at our ill manners.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1203pm-p3">Well may our God be glorious in the eyes of his people, seeing that 
he has wrought such wonders for them, in them, and by them. <i>For them</i>, the Lord Jesus upon Calvary routed every foe, breaking all the weapons 
of the enemy in pieces by his finished work of satisfactory obedience; 
by his triumphant resurrection and ascension he completely overturned 
the hopes of hell, leading captivity captive, making a show of our 
enemies openly, triumphing over them by his cross. Every arrow of 
guilt which Satan might have shot at us is broken, for who can lay 
anything to the charge of God’s elect? Vain are the sharp swords of infernal malice, and the perpetual 
battles of the serpent’s seed, for in the midst of the church the lame take the prey, and 
the feeblest warriors are crowned.</p>

of their rebellion broken. What victories has grace won in our evil 
hearts! How glorious is Jesus when the will is subdued, and sin dethroned! 
As for our remaining corruptions, they shall sustain an equally sure 
defeat, and every temptation, and doubt, and fear, shall be utterly 
destroyed. In the Salem of our peaceful hearts, the name of Jesus 
is great beyond compare: he has won our love, and he shall wear it. 
Even thus securely may we look for victories <i>by us</i>. We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. We shall 
cast down the powers of darkness which are in the world, by our faith, 
and zeal, and holiness; we shall win sinners to Jesus, we shall overturn 
false systems, we shall convert nations, for God is with us, and none 
shall stand before us. This evening let the Christian warrior chant 
the war song, and prepare for to-morrow’s fight. Greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1204am-p3">This should be a great encouragement to try to do good, since God 
has among the vilest of the vile, the most reprobate, the most debauched 
and drunken, an elect people who must be saved. When you take the 
Word to them, you do so because God has ordained you to be the messenger 
of life to their souls, and <i>they must</i> receive it, for so the decree of predestination runs. They are as 
much redeemed by blood as the saints before the eternal throne. They 
are Christ’s property, and yet perhaps they are lovers of the ale-house, and 
haters of holiness; but if Jesus Christ purchased them he will have 
them. God is not unfaithful to forget the price which his Son has 
paid. He will not suffer his substitution to be in any case an ineffectual, 
dead thing. Tens of thousands of redeemed ones are not regenerated 
yet, but regenerated they must be; and this is our comfort when we 
go forth to them with the quickening Word of God.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1204am-p4">Nay, more, these ungodly ones are prayed for by Christ before the 
throne. “Neither pray I for these alone,” saith the great Intercessor, “but for <i>them also which shall believe</i> on me through their word.” Poor, ignorant souls, they know nothing about prayer for themselves, 
but Jesus prays for them. Their names are on his breastplate, and 
ere long they must bow their stubborn knee, breathing the penitential 
sigh before the throne of grace. “The time of figs is not yet.” The predestinated moment has not struck; but, when it comes, <i>they shall obey</i>, for God will have his own; <i>they must</i>, for the Spirit is not to be withstood when he cometh forth with 
fulness of power—<i>they must</i> become the willing servants of the living God. “My people shall be willing in the day of my power.” “He shall justify many.” “He shall see of the travail of his soul.” “I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the 
spoil with the strong.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1204pm-p3">This groaning is universal among the saints: to a greater or less 
extent we all feel it. It is not the groan of murmuring or complaint: 
it is rather the note of desire than of distress. Having received 
an earnest, we desire the whole of our portion; we are sighing that 
our entire manhood, in its trinity of spirit, soul, and body, may 
be set free from the last vestige of the fall; we long to put off 
corruption, weakness, and dishonour, and to wrap ourselves in incorruption, 
in immortality, in glory, in the spiritual body which the Lord Jesus 
will bestow upon his people. We long for the manifestation of our 
adoption as the children of God. “We groan,” but it is “<i>within ourselves</i>.” It is not the hypocrite’s groan, by which he would make men believe that he is a saint because 
he is wretched. Our sighs are sacred things, too hallowed for us to 
tell abroad. We keep our longings to our Lord alone. Then the apostle 
says we are “<i>waiting</i>,” by which we learn that we are not to be petulant, like Jonah or Elijah, 
when they said, “Let me die”; nor are we to whimper and sigh for the end of life because we are 
tired of work, nor wish to escape from our present sufferings till 
the will of the Lord is done. We are to groan for glorification, but 
we are to wait patiently for it, knowing that what the Lord appoints 
is best. Waiting implies being ready. We are to stand at the door 
expecting the Beloved to open it and take us away to himself. This 
“groaning” is a test. You may judge of a man by what he groans after. Some men 
groan after wealth—they worship Mammon; some groan continually under the troubles of 
life—they are merely impatient; but the man who sighs after God, who is 
uneasy till he is made like Christ, that is the blessed man. May God 
help us to groan for the coming of the Lord, and the resurrection 
which he will bring to us.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1205am-p3">We know of a place in England still existing, where a dole of bread 
is served to every passerby who chooses to ask for it. Whoever the 
traveller may be, he has but to knock at the door of St. Cross Hospital, 
and there is the dole of bread for him. Jesus Christ so loveth sinners 
that he has built a St. Cross Hospital, so that whenever a sinner 
is hungry, he has but to knock and have his wants supplied. Nay, he 
has done better; he has attached to this Hospital of the Cross a bath; 
and whenever a soul is black and filthy, it has but to go there and 
be washed. The fountain is always full, always efficacious. No sinner 
ever went into it and found that it could not wash away his stains. 
Sins which were scarlet and crimson have all disappeared, and the 
sinner has been whiter than snow. As if this were not enough, there 
is attached to this Hospital of the Cross a wardrobe, and a sinner 
making application simply as a sinner, may be clothed from head to 
foot; and if he wishes to be a soldier, he may not merely have a garment 
for ordinary wear, but armour which shall cover him from the sole 
of his foot to the crown of his head. If he asks for a sword, he shall 
have that given to him, and a shield too. Nothing that is good for 
him shall be denied him. He shall have spending-money so long as he 
lives, and he shall have an eternal heritage of glorious treasure 
when he enters into the joy of his Lord.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1205am-p4">If all these things are to be had by merely knocking at mercy’s door, O my soul, knock hard this morning, and ask large things of 
thy generous Lord. Leave not the throne of grace till all thy wants 
have been spread before the Lord, and until by faith thou hast a comfortable 
prospect that they shall be all supplied. No bashfulness need retard 
when Jesus invites. No unbelief should hinder when Jesus promises. 
No cold-heartedness should restrain when such blessings are to be 
obtained.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1205pm-p3">In the vision described in this chapter, the prophet saw four terrible 
horns. They were pushing this way and that way, dashing down the strongest 
and the mightiest; and the prophet asked, “What are these?” The answer was, “These are the horns which have scattered Israel.” He saw before him a representation of those powers which had oppressed 
the church of God. There were four horns; for the church is attacked 
from all quarters. Well might the prophet have felt dismayed; but 
on a sudden there appeared before him <i>four carpenters</i>. He asked, “What shall these do?” These are the men whom God hath found to break those horns in pieces. 
<i>God will always find men for his work</i>, and he will find them at the right time. The prophet did not see 
the carpenters <i>first</i>, when there was nothing to do, but first the “horns,” and then the “carpenters.” Moreover, the Lord finds <i>enough men</i>. He did not find three carpenters, but <i>four</i>; there were four horns, and there must be four workmen. God finds 
<i>the right men</i>; not four men with pens to write; not four architects to draw plans; 
but four carpenters to do rough work. Rest assured, you who tremble 
for the ark of God, that when the “horns” grow troublesome, the “carpenters” will be found. You need not fret concerning the weakness of the church 
of God at any moment; there may be growing up in obscurity the valiant 
reformer who will shake the nations: Chrysostoms may come forth from 
our Ragged Schools, and Augustines from the thickest darkness of London’s poverty. The Lord knows where to find his servants. He hath in ambush 
a multitude of mighty men, and at his word they shall start up to 
the battle; “for the battle is the Lord's,” and he shall get to himself the victory. Let us abide faithful to 
Christ, and he, in the right time, will raise up for us a defence, 
whether it be in the day of our personal need, or in the season of 
peril to his Church.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1206am-p3">The head and members are of one nature, and not like that monstrous 
image which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. The head was of fine 
gold, but the belly and thighs were of brass, the legs of iron, and 
the feet, part of iron and part of clay. Christ’s mystical body is no absurd combination of opposites; the members 
were mortal, and therefore Jesus died; the glorified head is immortal, 
and therefore the body is immortal too, for thus the record stands, 
“Because I live, ye shall live also.” As is our loving Head, such is the body, and every member in particular. 
A chosen Head and chosen members; an accepted Head, and accepted members; 
a living Head, and living members. If the head be pure gold, all the 
parts of the body are of pure gold also. Thus is there a double union 
of nature as a basis for the closest communion. Pause here, devout 
reader, and see if thou canst without ecstatic amazement, contemplate 
the infinite condescension of the Son of God in thus exalting thy 
wretchedness into blessed union with his glory. Thou art so mean that 
in remembrance of thy mortality, thou mayest say to corruption, “Thou art my father,” and to the worm, “Thou art my sister”; and yet in Christ thou art so honoured that thou canst say to the 
Almighty, “Abba, Father,” and to the Incarnate God, “Thou art my brother and my husband.” Surely if relationships to ancient and noble families make men think 
highly of themselves, we have whereof to glory over the heads of them 
all. Let the poorest and most despised believer lay hold upon this 
privilege; let not a senseless indolence make him negligent to trace 
his pedigree, and let him suffer no foolish attachment to present 
vanities to occupy his thoughts to the exclusion of this glorious,

throne he stays not His holy ministry, but as a priest is girt about 
with “the curious girdle of the ephod.” Well it is for us that he has not ceased to fulfil his offices of 
love for us, since this is one of our choicest safeguards that he 
ever liveth to make intercession for us. Jesus is never an idler; 
his garments are never loose as though his offices were ended; he 
diligently carries on the cause of his people. <i>A golden</i> <i>girdle</i>, to manifest the superiority of his service, the royalty of his person, 
the dignity of his state, the glory of his reward. No longer does

<p class="normal" id="d1206pm-p4">Our Lord presents all his people with an example. We must never unbind 
our girdles. This is not the time for lying down at ease, it is the

more and more tightly around our loins. It is a golden girdle, and 
so will be our richest ornament, and we greatly need it, for a heart 
that is not well braced up with the truth as it is in Jesus, and with 
the fidelity which is wrought of the Spirit, will be easily entangled 
with the things of this life, and tripped up by the snares of temptation. 
It is in vain that we possess the Scriptures unless we bind them around 
us like a girdle, surrounding our entire nature, keeping each part 
of our character in order, and giving compactness to our whole man. 
If in heaven Jesus unbinds not the girdle, much less may we upon earth. 
Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.</p>

Blood-red will our skirts be if through life we have sought inferior 
objects, and forgotten that men needed to be saved. Paul knew the 
ruin of man’s natural state, and did not try to educate him, but to save him; 
he saw men sinking to hell, and did not talk of refining them, but 
of saving from the wrath to come. To compass their salvation, he gave 
himself up with untiring zeal to telling abroad the gospel, to warning 
and beseeching men to be reconciled to God. His prayers were importunate 
and his labours incessant. To save souls was his consuming passion, 
his ambition, his calling. He became a servant to all men, toiling 
for his race, feeling a woe within him if he preached not the gospel. 
He laid aside his preferences to prevent prejudice; he submitted his 
will in things indifferent, and if men would but receive the gospel, 
he raised no questions about forms or ceremonies: the gospel was the 
one all-important business with him. If he might save some he would 
be content. This was the crown for which he strove, the sole and sufficient 
reward of all his labours and self-denials. Dear reader, have you 
and I lived to win souls at this noble rate? Are we possessed with 
the same all-absorbing desire? If not, why not? Jesus died for sinners, 
cannot we live for them? Where is our tenderness? Where our love to 
Christ, if we seek not his honour in the salvation of men? O that 
the Lord would saturate us through and through with an undying zeal 
for the souls of men.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1208am-p3">We may understand this to refer to <i>justification</i>. “They shall walk in white;” that is, they shall enjoy a constant sense of their own justification

imputed to them, that they have all been washed and made whiter than 
the newly-fallen snow.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1208am-p4">Again, it refers to <i>joy and gladness</i>: for white robes were holiday dresses among the Jews. They who have 
not defiled their garments shall have their faces always bright; they 
shall understand what Solomon meant when he said “Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry 
heart. Let thy garments be always white, for God hath accepted thy 
works.” He who is accepted of God shall wear white garments of joy and gladness, 
while he walks in sweet communion with the Lord Jesus. Whence so many 
doubts, so much misery, and mourning? It is because so many believers 
defile their garments with sin and error, and hence they lose the 
joy of their salvation, and the comfortable fellowship of the Lord 
Jesus, they do not here below walk in white.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1208am-p5">The promise also refers to <i>walking in white before the</i> <i>throne of God</i>. Those who have not defiled their garments here shall most certainly 
walk in white up yonder, where the white-robed hosts sing perpetual 
hallelujahs to the Most High. They shall possess joys inconceivable, 
happiness beyond a dream, bliss which imagination knoweth not, blessedness 
which even the stretch of desire hath not reached. The “undefiled in the way” shall have all this—not of merit, nor of works, but of grace. They shall walk with Christ 
in white, for he has made them “worthy.” In his sweet company they shall drink of the living fountains of 
waters.</p>

anticipates our needs; and out of the fulness which he has treasured 
up in Christ Jesus, he provides of his goodness for the poor. You 
may trust him for all the necessities that can occur, for he has infallibly 
foreknown every one of them. He can say of us in all conditions, “I knew that thou wouldst be this and that.” A man goes a journey across the desert, and when he has made a day’s advance, and pitched his tent, he discovers that he wants many comforts 
and necessaries which he has not brought in his baggage. “Ah!” says he, “I did not foresee this: if I had this journey to go again, I should 
bring these things with me, so necessary to my comfort.” But God has marked with prescient eye all the requirements of his 
poor wandering children, and when those needs occur, supplies are 
ready. It is goodness which he has prepared for the poor in heart, 
goodness and goodness only. “My grace is sufficient for thee.” “As thy days, so shall thy strength be.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1208pm-p4">Reader, is your heart heavy this evening? God knew it would be; the 
comfort which your heart wants is treasured in the sweet assurance 
of the text. You are poor and needy, but he has thought upon you, 
and has the exact blessing which you require in store for you. Plead 
the promise, believe it and obtain its fulfilment. Do you feel that 
you never were so consciously vile as you are now? Behold, the crimson 
fountain is open still, with all its former efficacy, to wash your 
sin away. Never shall you come into such a position that Christ cannot 
aid you. No pinch shall ever arrive in your spiritual affairs in which 
Jesus Christ shall not be equal to the emergency, for your history 
has all been foreknown and provided for in Jesus.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1209am-p3">God often <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1209am-p3.1">delays in answering prayer</span>. We have several instances of this in sacred Scripture. Jacob did 
not get the blessing from the angel until near the dawn of day—he had to wrestle all night for it. The poor woman of Syrophoenicia 
was answered not a word for a long while. Paul besought the Lord <i>thrice</i> that “the thorn in the flesh” might be taken from him, and he received no assurance that it should 
be taken away, but instead thereof a promise that God’s grace should be sufficient for him. If thou hast been knocking at 
the gate of mercy, and hast received no answer, shall I tell thee 
why the mighty Maker hath not opened the door and let thee in? Our 
Father has reasons peculiar to himself for thus keeping us waiting. 
Sometimes it is to show his power and his sovereignty, that men may 
know that Jehovah has a right to give or to withhold. More frequently 
the delay is for our profit. Thou art perhaps kept waiting in order 
that thy desires may be more fervent. God knows that delay will quicken 
and increase desire, and that if he keeps thee waiting thou wilt see 
thy necessity more clearly, and wilt seek more earnestly; and that 
thou wilt prize the mercy all the more for its long tarrying. There 
may also be something wrong in thee which has need to be removed, 
before the joy of the Lord is given. Perhaps thy views of the Gospel 
plan are confused, or thou mayest be placing some little reliance 
on thyself, instead of trusting simply and entirely to the Lord Jesus. 
Or, God makes thee tarry awhile that he may the more fully display 
the riches of his grace to thee at last. Thy prayers are all filed 
in heaven, and if not immediately answered they are certainly not 
forgotten, but in a little while shall be fulfilled to thy delight 
and satisfaction. Let not despair make thee silent, but continue instant 
in earnest supplication.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1209pm-p3">Peace and rest belong not to the unregenerate; they are the peculiar 
possession of the Lord’s people, and of them only. The God of Peace gives perfect peace to 
those whose hearts are stayed upon him. When man was unfallen, his 
God gave him the flowery bowers of Eden as his quiet resting places; 
alas! how soon sin blighted the fair abode of innocence. In the day 
of universal wrath when the flood swept away a guilty race, the chosen 
family were quietly secured in the resting-place of the ark, which 
floated them from the old condemned world into the new earth of the 
rainbow and the covenant, herein typifying Jesus, the ark of our salvation. 
Israel rested safely beneath the blood-besprinkled habitations of 
Egypt when the destroying angel smote the first-born; and in the wilderness 
the shadow of the pillar of cloud, and the flowing rock, gave the 
weary pilgrims sweet repose. At this hour we rest in the promises 
of our faithful God, knowing that his words are full of truth and 
power; we rest in the doctrines of his word, which are consolation 
itself; we rest in the covenant of his grace, which is a haven of 
delight. More highly favoured are we than David in Adullam, or Jonah 
beneath his gourd, for none can invade or destroy our shelter. The 
person of Jesus is the quiet resting-place of his people, and when 
we draw near to him in the breaking of the bread, in the hearing of 
the word, the searching of the Scriptures, prayer, or praise, we find 
any form of approach to him to be the return of peace to our spirits.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1210pm-p3">In Lydia’s conversion there are many points of interest. It was brought about 
by <i>providential circumstances</i>. She was a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, but just at 
the right time for hearing Paul we find her at Philippi; providence, 
which is the handmaid of grace, led her to the right spot. Again, 
<i>grace was preparing her soul for the blessing</i>—grace preparing for grace. She did not know the Saviour, but as a 
Jewess, she knew many truths which were excellent stepping-stones 
to a knowledge of Jesus. Her conversion took place in the use of the 
means. On the Sabbath she went when prayer was wont to be made, and 
there prayer was heard. Never neglect the means of grace; God <i>may</i> bless us when we are not in his house, but we have the greater reason 
to hope that he <i>will</i> when we are in communion with his saints. Observe the words, “Whose heart <i>the Lord</i> opened.” She did not open her own heart. Her prayers did not do it; Paul did 
not do it. The Lord himself must open the heart, to receive the things 
which make for our peace. He alone can put the key into the hole of 
the door and open it, and get admittance for himself. He is the heart’s master as he is the heart’s maker. The first outward evidence of the opened heart was <i>obedience</i>. As soon as Lydia had believed in Jesus, she was baptized. It is 
a sweet sign of a humble and broken heart, when the child of God is 
willing to obey a command which is not essential to his salvation, 
which is not forced upon him by a selfish fear of condemnation, but 
is a simple act of obedience and of communion with his Master. The 
next evidence was <i>love</i>, manifesting itself in acts of grateful kindness to the apostles. 
Love to the saints has ever been a mark of the true convert. Those 
who do nothing for Christ or his church, give but sorry evidence of 
an “opened” heart. Lord, evermore give me an opened heart.</p>

be no tempter to ensnare our feet. There the wicked cease from troubling, 
and the weary are at rest. Heaven is the “undefiled inheritance;” it is the land of perfect holiness, and therefore of complete security. 
But do not the saints even on earth sometimes taste the joys of blissful 
security? The doctrine of God’s word is, that all who are in union with the Lamb are safe; that 
all the righteous shall hold on their way; that those who have committed 
their souls to the keeping of Christ shall find him a faithful and 
immutable preserver. Sustained by such a doctrine we can enjoy security 
even on earth; not that high and glorious security which renders us 
free from every slip, but that holy security which arises from the 
sure promise of Jesus that none who believe in him shall ever perish, 
but shall be with him where he is. Believer, let us often reflect 
with joy on the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, and honour 
the faithfulness of our God by a holy confidence in him.</p>

May he assure you that your name is graven on his hand; and whisper

true, and, therefore, bound and engaged to present you, the weakest 
of the family, with all the chosen race, before the throne of God; 
and in such a sweet contemplation you will drink the juice of the 
spiced wine of the Lord’s pomegranate, and taste the dainty fruits of Paradise. You will have 
an antepast of the enjoyments which ravish the souls of the perfect 
saints above, if you can believe with unstaggering faith that <i>“faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d1211pm-p3">To what choice order of officials was this word spoken? To kings who 
proudly boast a right divine? Ah, no! too often do they serve themselves 
or Satan, and forget the God whose sufferance permits them to wear 
their mimic majesty for their little hour. Speaks then the apostle 
to those so-called “right reverend fathers in God,” the bishops, or “the venerable the archdeacons”? No, indeed, Paul knew nothing of these mere inventions of man. Not 
even to pastors and teachers, or to the wealthy and esteemed among 
believers, was this word spoken, but to servants, aye, and to slaves. 
Among the toiling multitudes, the journeymen, the day labourers, the 
domestic servants, the drudges of the kitchen, the apostle found, 
as we find still, some of the Lord’s chosen, and to them he says, “Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 
knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: 
for ye serve the Lord Christ.” This saying ennobles the weary routine of earthly employments, and 
sheds a halo around the most humble occupations. To wash feet may 
be servile, but to wash <i>his</i> feet is royal work. To unloose the shoe-latchet is poor employ, but 
to unloose the great Master’s shoe is a princely privilege. The shop, the barn, the scullery, 
and the smithy become temples when men and women do all to the glory 
of God! Then “divine service” is not a thing of a few hours and a few places, but all life becomes 
holiness unto the Lord, and every place and thing, as consecrated

<p class="normal" id="d1212am-p3">What he hath done at one time, he will do yet again. Man’s ways are variable, but God’s ways are everlasting. There are many reasons for this most comforting 
truth: among them are the following—the Lord’s ways are <i>the result of wise</i> <i>deliberation</i>; he ordereth all things according to the counsel of his own will. 
Human action is frequently the hasty result of passion, or fear, and 
is followed by regret and alteration; but nothing can take the Almighty 
by surprise, or happen otherwise than he has foreseen. His ways are 
<i>the</i> <i>outgrowth of an immutable character</i>, and in them the fixed and settled attributes of God are clearly 
to be seen. Unless the Eternal One himself can undergo change, his 
ways, which are himself in action, must remain forever the same. Is 
he eternally just, gracious, faithful, wise, tender?—then his ways must ever be distinguished for the same excellences. 
Beings act according to their nature: when those natures change, their 
conduct varies also; but since God cannot know the shadow of a turning, 
his ways will abide everlastingly the same. Moreover there is no reason 
from without which could reverse the divine ways, since they are the 
<i>embodiment of irresistible might</i>. The earth is said, by the prophet, to be cleft with rivers, mountains 
tremble, the deep lifts up its hands, and sun and moon stand still, 
when Jehovah marches forth for the salvation of his people. Who can 
stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? But it is not might 
alone which gives stability; God’s ways are <i>the manifestation of the eternal principles of right</i>, and therefore can never pass away. Wrong breeds decay and involves 
ruin, but the true and the good have about them a vitality which ages 
cannot diminish.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1212am-p4">This morning let us go to our heavenly Father with confidence, remembering 
that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in 
him the Lord is ever gracious to his people.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1212pm-p3">Believer, here is a sorrowful truth! Thou art the beloved of the Lord, 
redeemed by blood, called by grace, preserved in Christ Jesus, accepted 
in the Beloved, on thy way to heaven, and yet, “thou hast dealt treacherously” with God, thy best friend; treacherously with Jesus, whose thou art; 
treacherously with the Holy Spirit, by whom thou hast been quickened 
unto life eternal! How treacherous you have been in the matter of 
vows and promises. Do you remember the love of your espousals, that 
happy time—the springtime of your spiritual life? Oh, how closely did you cling 
to your Master then! saying, “He shall never charge me with indifference; my feet shall never grow 
slow in the way of his service; I will not suffer my heart to wander 
after other loves; in him is every store of sweetness ineffable. I 
give all up for my Lord Jesus’ sake.” Has it been so? Alas! if conscience speak, it will say, “He who promised so well has performed most ill. Prayer has oftentimes 
been slurred—it has been short, but not sweet; brief, but not fervent. Communion 
with Christ has been forgotten. Instead of a heavenly mind, there 
have been carnal cares, worldly vanities and thoughts of evil. Instead 
of service, there has been disobedience; instead of fervency, lukewarmness; 
instead of patience, petulance; instead of faith, confidence in an 
arm of flesh; and as a soldier of the cross there has been cowardice, 
disobedience, and desertion, to a very shameful degree.” “Thou hast dealt treacherously.” Treachery to Jesus! what words shall be used in denouncing it? Words 
little avail: let our penitent thoughts execrate the sin which is 
so surely in us. Treacherous to thy wounds, O Jesus! Forgive us, and 
let us not sin again! How shameful to be treacherous to him who never 
forgets us, but who this day stands with our names engraven on his 
breastplate before the eternal throne.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1213am-p3">Salt was used in every offering made by fire unto the Lord, and from 
its preserving and purifying properties it was the grateful emblem 
of divine grace in the soul. It is worthy of our attentive regard 
that, when Artaxerxes gave salt to Ezra the priest, he set no limit 
to the quantity, and we may be quite certain that when the King of 
kings distributes grace among his royal priesthood, the supply is 
not cut short by <i>him</i>. Often are we straitened in ourselves, but never in the Lord. He 
who chooses to gather much manna will find that he may have as much 
as he desires. There is no such famine in Jerusalem that the citizens 
should eat their bread by weight and drink their water by measure. 
Some things in the economy of grace are measured; for instance our 
vinegar and gall are given us with such exactness that we never have 
a single drop too much, but of the salt of grace no stint is made, 
“Ask what thou wilt and it shall be given unto thee.” Parents need to lock up the fruit cupboard, and the sweet jars, but 
there is no need to keep the salt-box under lock and key, for few 
children will eat too greedily from that. A man may have too much 
money, or too much honour, but he cannot have too much grace. When 
Jeshurun waxed fat in the flesh, he kicked against God, but there 
is no fear of a man’s becoming too full of grace: a <i>plethora</i> of grace is impossible. More wealth brings more care, but more grace 
brings more joy. Increased wisdom is increased sorrow, but abundance 
of the Spirit is fulness of joy. Believer, go to the throne for a 
large supply of heavenly salt. It will season thine afflictions, which 
are unsavoury without salt; it will preserve thy heart which corrupts 
if salt be absent, and it will kill thy sins even as salt kills reptiles. 
Thou needest much; seek much, and have much.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1213pm-p3">The church is most instructively symbolized by a building erected 
by heavenly power, and designed by divine skill. Such a spiritual 
house must not be dark, for the Israelites had light in their dwellings; 
there must therefore be windows to let the light in and to allow the 
inhabitants to gaze abroad. These windows are <i>precious</i> as agates: the ways in which the church beholds her Lord and heaven, 
and spiritual truth in general, are to be had in the highest esteem. 
Agates are <i>not the most</i> <i>transparent</i> of gems, they are but semi-pellucid at the best:</p>
<verse id="d1213pm-p3.1">
  <l class="t1" id="d1213pm-p3.2">“Our knowledge of that life is small,</l>
  <l class="t1" id="d1213pm-p3.3">Our eye of faith is dim.”</l>
</verse>
<p class="normal" id="d1213pm-p4"><i>Faith</i> is one of these precious agate windows, but alas! it is often so 
misty and beclouded, that we see but darkly, and mistake much that 
we do see. Yet if we cannot gaze through windows of diamonds and know 
even as we are known, it is a glorious thing to behold the altogether 
lovely One, even though the glass be hazy as the agate. <i>Experience</i> is another of these dim but precious windows, yielding to us a subdued 
religious light, in which we see the sufferings of the Man of Sorrows, 
through our own afflictions. Our weak eyes could not endure windows 
of transparent glass to let in the Master’s glory, but when they are dimmed with weeping, the beams of the Sun 
of Righteousness are tempered, and shine through the windows of agate 
with a soft radiance inexpressibly soothing to tempted souls. <i>Sanctification</i>, as it conforms us to our Lord, is another agate window. Only as 
we become heavenly can we comprehend heavenly things. The pure in 
heart see a pure God. Those who are like Jesus see him as he is. Because 
we are so little like him, the window is but agate; because we are 
somewhat like him, it is agate. We thank God for what we have, and 
long for more. When shall we see God and Jesus, and heaven and truth, 
face to face?</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1214am-p3">They go from <i>strength to strength</i>. There are various renderings of these words, but all of them contain 
the idea of progress.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1214am-p4">Our own good translation of the authorized version is enough for us 
this morning. “They go from strength to strength.” That is, they grow stronger and stronger. Usually, if we are walking, 
we go from strength to weakness; we start fresh and in good order 
for our journey, but by-and-by the road is rough, and the sun is hot, 
we sit down by the wayside, and then again painfully pursue our weary 
way. But the Christian pilgrim having obtained fresh supplies of grace, 
is as vigorous after years of toilsome travel and struggle as when 
he first set out. He may not be quite so elate and buoyant, nor perhaps 
quite so hot and hasty in his zeal as he once was, but he is much 
stronger in all that constitutes real power, and travels, if more 
slowly, far more surely. Some gray-haired veterans have been as firm 
in their grasp of truth, and as zealous in diffusing it, as they were 
in their younger days; but, alas, it must be confessed it is often 
otherwise, for the love of many waxes cold and iniquity abounds, but 
this is their own sin and not the fault of the promise which still 
holds good: “The youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly 
fall, but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; 
they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be 
weary, and they shall walk and not faint.” Fretful spirits sit down and trouble themselves about the future. 
“Alas!” say they, “we go from affliction to affliction.” Very true, O thou of little faith, but then thou goest from strength 
to strength also. Thou shalt never find a bundle of affliction which 
has not bound up in the midst of it sufficient grace. God will give 
the strength of ripe manhood with the burden allotted to full-grown 
shoulders.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1214pm-p3">The Lord Jesus Christ acted in what he did as a great public representative 
person, and his dying upon the cross was the virtual dying of all 
his people. Then all his saints rendered unto justice what was due, 
and made an expiation to divine vengeance for all their sins. The 
apostle of the Gentiles delighted to think that as one of Christ’s chosen people, he died upon the cross in Christ. He did more than 
believe this doctrinally, he accepted it confidently, resting his 
hope upon it. He believed that by virtue of Christ’s death, he had satisfied divine justice, and found reconciliation 
with God. Beloved, what a blessed thing it is when the soul can, as 
it were, stretch itself upon the cross of Christ, and feel, “I am dead; the law has slain me, and I am therefore free from its 
power, because in my Surety I have borne the curse, and in the person 
of my Substitute the whole that the law could do, by way of condemnation, 
has been executed upon me, for I am crucified with Christ.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1214pm-p4">But Paul meant even more than this. He not only believed in Christ’s death, and trusted in it, but he actually felt its power in himself 
in causing the crucifixion of his old corrupt nature. When he saw 
the pleasures of sin, he said, “I cannot enjoy these: I am dead to them.” Such is the experience of every true Christian. Having received Christ, 
he is to this world as one who is utterly dead. Yet, while conscious 
of death to the world, he can, at the same time, exclaim with the 
apostle, “Nevertheless I live.” He is fully alive unto God. The Christian’s life is a matchless riddle. No worldling can comprehend it; even 
the believer himself cannot understand it. Dead, yet alive! crucified 
with Christ, and yet at the same time risen with Christ in newness 
of life! Union with the suffering, bleeding Saviour, and death to 
the world and sin, are soul-cheering things. O for more enjoyment 
of them!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1215am-p3">Both of them had an affection for Naomi, and therefore set out with 
her upon her return to the land of Judah. But the hour of test came; 
Naomi most unselfishly set before each of them the trials which awaited 
them, and bade them if they cared for ease and comfort to return to 
their Moabitish friends. At first both of them declared that they 
would cast in their lot with the Lord’s people; but upon still further consideration Orpah with much grief 
and a respectful kiss left her mother in law, and her people, and 
her God, and went back to her idolatrous friends, while Ruth with 
all her heart gave herself up to the God of her mother in law. It 
is one thing to love the ways of the Lord when all is fair, and quite 
another to cleave to them under all discouragements and difficulties. 
The kiss of outward profession is very cheap and easy, but the practical 
cleaving to the Lord, which must show itself in holy decision for 
truth and holiness, is not so small a matter. How stands the case 
with us, is our heart fixed upon Jesus, is the sacrifice bound with 
cords to the horns of the altar? Have we counted the cost, and are 
we solemnly ready to suffer all worldly loss for the Master’s sake? The after gain will be an abundant recompense, for Egypt’s treasures are not to be compared with the glory to be revealed. 
Orpah is heard of no more; in glorious ease and idolatrous pleasure 
her life melts into the gloom of death; but Ruth lives in history 
and in heaven, for grace has placed her in the noble line whence sprung 
the King of kings. Blessed among women shall those be who for Christ’s sake can renounce all; but forgotten and worse than forgotten shall 
those be who in the hour of temptation do violence to conscience and 
turn back unto the world. O that this morning we may not be content 
with the form of devotion, which may be no better than Orpah’s kiss, but may the Holy Spirit work in us a cleaving of our whole 
heart to our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1215pm-p3">Not only that which is seen of the church of God, but that which is 
unseen, is fair and precious. Foundations are out of sight, and so 
long as they are firm it is not expected that they should be valuable; 
but in Jehovah’s work everything is of a piece, nothing slurred, nothing mean. The 
deep foundations of the work of grace are as sapphires for preciousness, 
no human mind is able to measure their glory. We build upon the <i>covenant of grace</i>, which is firmer than adamant, and as enduring as jewels upon which 
age spends itself in vain. Sapphire foundations are eternal, and the 
covenant abides throughout the lifetime of the Almighty. Another foundation 
is <i>the person of the Lord Jesus</i>, which is clear and spotless, everlasting and beautiful as the sapphire; 
blending in one the deep blue of earth’s ever rolling ocean and the azure of its all embracing sky. Once 
might our Lord have been likened to the ruby as he stood covered with 
his own blood, but now we see him radiant with the soft blue of love, 
love abounding, deep, eternal. Our eternal hopes are built upon <i>the justice and the</i> <i>faithfulness of God</i>, which are clear and cloudless as the sapphire. We are not saved 
by a compromise, by mercy defeating justice, or law suspending its 
operations; no, we defy the eagle’s eye to detect a flaw in the groundwork of our confidence—our foundation is of sapphire, and will endure the fire.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1215pm-p4">The Lord himself has laid the foundation of his people’s hopes. It is matter for grave enquiry whether <i>our</i> hopes are built upon such a basis. Good works and ceremonies are 
not a foundation of sapphires, but of wood, hay, and stubble; neither 
are they laid by God, but by our own conceit. Foundations will all 
be tried ere long: woe unto him whose lofty tower shall come down 
with a crash, because based on a quicksand. He who is built on sapphires 
may await storm or fire with equanimity, for he shall abide the test.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1216am-p3">The cry of the Christian religion is the gentle word, “Come.” The Jewish law harshly said, “Go, take heed unto thy steps as to the path in which thou shalt walk. 
Break the commandments, and thou shalt perish; keep them, and thou 
shalt live.” The law was a dispensation of terror, which drove men before it as 
with a scourge; the gospel draws with bands of love. Jesus is the 
good Shepherd going before his sheep, bidding them follow him, and 
ever leading them onwards with the sweet word, “Come.” The law repels, the gospel attracts. The law shows the distance which 
there is between God and man; the gospel bridges that awful chasm, 
and brings the sinner across it.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1216am-p4">From the first moment of your spiritual life until you are ushered 
into glory, the language of Christ to you will be, “<i>Come, come</i> unto me.” As a mother puts out her finger to her little child and woos it to 
walk by saying, “<i>Come</i>,” even so does Jesus. He will always be ahead of you, bidding you follow 
him as the soldier follows his captain. He will always go before you 
to pave your way, and clear your path, and you shall hear his animating 
voice calling you after him all through life; while in the solemn 
hour of death, his sweet words with which he shall usher you into 
the heavenly world shall be—“Come, ye blessed of my Father.”</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1216am-p5">Nay, further, this is not only Christ’s cry to you, but, if you be a believer, this is your cry to Christ—“Come! come!” You will be longing for his second advent; you will be saying, “Come quickly, even so come Lord Jesus.” You will be panting for nearer and closer communion with him. As 
his voice to you is “Come,” your response to him will be, “Come, Lord, and abide with me. Come, and occupy alone the throne of 
my heart; reign there without a rival, and consecrate me entirely 
to thy service.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1216pm-p3">It is painful to remember that, in a certain degree, this accusation 
may be laid at the door of <i>believers</i>, who too often are in a measure <i>spiritually insensible</i>. We may well bewail ourselves that <i>we</i> do not hear the voice of God as we ought, “Yea, thou heardest not.” There are gentle motions of the Holy Spirit in the soul which are 
unheeded by us: there are whisperings of divine command and of heavenly 
love which are alike unobserved by our leaden intellects. Alas! we 
have been <i>carelessly ignorant</i>—“Yea, thou knewest not.” There are matters within which we ought to have seen, corruptions 
which have made headway unnoticed; sweet affections which are being 
blighted like flowers in the frost, untended by us; glimpses of the 
divine face which might be perceived if we did not wall up the windows 
of our soul. But we “have not known.” As we think of it we are humbled in the deepest self-abasement. How 
must we adore the grace of God as we learn from the context that all 
this folly and ignorance, on our part, <i>was foreknown by God</i>, and, notwithstanding that foreknowledge, he yet has been pleased 
to deal with us in a way of mercy! Admire the marvellous sovereign 
grace which could have chosen us in the sight of all this! Wonder 
at the price that was paid for us when Christ knew what we should 
be! He who hung upon the cross foresaw us as unbelieving, backsliding, 
cold of heart, indifferent, careless, lax in prayer, and yet he said, 
“I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour ... Since 
thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have 
loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy 
life!” O redemption, how wondrously resplendent dost thou shine when we 
think how black we are! O Holy Spirit, give us henceforth the hearing 
ear, the understanding heart!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1217am-p3">Let us note that Christ delights to think upon his Church, and to 
look upon her beauty. As the bird returneth often to its nest, and 
as the wayfarer hastens to his home, so doth the mind continually 
pursue the object of its choice. We cannot look too often upon that 
face which we love; we desire always to have our precious things in 
our sight. It is even so with our Lord Jesus. From all eternity “His delights were with the sons of men;” his thoughts rolled onward to the time when his elect should be born 
into the world; he viewed them in the mirror of his foreknowledge. 
“In thy book,” he says, “all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, 
when as yet there was none of them” (<scripRef passage="Ps 139:16" id="d1217am-p3.1" parsed="|Ps|139|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.139.16">Ps. 139:16</scripRef>). When the world was set upon its pillars, he was there, and he set 
the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of 
Israel. Many a time before his incarnation, he descended to this lower 
earth in the similitude of a man; on the plains of Mamre (<scripRef passage="Ge 18" id="d1217am-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|18|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18">Gen. 18</scripRef>), by the brook of Jabbok (<scripRef passage="Ge 32:24-30" id="d1217am-p3.3" parsed="|Gen|32|24|32|30" osisRef="Bible:Gen.32.24-Gen.32.30">Gen. 32:24-30</scripRef>), beneath the walls of Jericho (<scripRef passage="Jos 5:13" id="d1217am-p3.5" parsed="|Josh|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Josh.5.13">Jos. 5:13</scripRef>), and in the fiery furnace of Babylon (<scripRef passage="Da 3:19" id="d1217am-p3.6" parsed="|Dan|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.19">Dan. 3:19</scripRef>, <scripRef passage="Da 3:25" id="d1217am-p3.7" parsed="|Dan|3|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.25">25</scripRef>), the Son of Man visited his people. Because his soul delighted in 
them, he could not rest away from them, for his heart longed after 
them. Never were they absent from his heart, for he had written their 
names upon his hands, and graven them upon his side. As the breastplate 
containing the names of the tribes of Israel was the most brilliant 
ornament worn by the high priest, so the names of Christ’s elect were his most precious jewels, and glittered on his heart. 
We may often forget to meditate upon the perfections of our Lord, 
but he never ceases to remember us. Let us chide ourselves for past 
forgetfulness, and pray for grace ever to bear him in fondest remembrance. 
Lord, paint upon the eyeballs of my soul the image of thy Son.</p>

by him four choice privileges.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1217pm-p4">1. <i>He shall be saved</i>. The fugitive manslayer passed the gate of the city of refuge, and 
was safe. Noah entered the door of the ark, and was secure. None can 
be lost who take Jesus as the door of faith to their souls. Entrance 
through Jesus into peace is the guarantee of entrance by the same 
door into heaven. Jesus is the only door, an open door, a wide door, 
a safe door; and blessed is he who rests all his hope of admission 
to glory upon the crucified Redeemer.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1217pm-p5">2. <i>He shall go in</i>. He shall be privileged to go in among the divine family, sharing 
the children’s bread, and participating in all their honours and enjoyments. He 
shall go in to the chambers of communion, to the banquets of love, 
to the treasures of the covenant, to the storehouses of the promises. 
He shall go in unto the King of kings in the power of the Holy Spirit, 
and the secret of the Lord shall be with him.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1217pm-p6">3. <i>He shall go out</i>. This blessing is much forgotten. We go out into the world to labour 
and suffer, but what a mercy to go in the name and power of Jesus! 
We are called to bear witness to the truth, to cheer the disconsolate, 
to warn the careless, to win souls, and to glorify God; and as the 
angel said to Gideon, “Go in this thy might,” even thus the Lord would have us proceed as his messengers in his 
name and strength.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1217pm-p7">4. <i>He shall find pasture</i>. He who knows Jesus shall never want. Going in and out shall be alike 
helpful to him: in fellowship with God he shall grow, and in watering 
others he shall be watered. Having made Jesus his all, he shall find 
all in Jesus. His soul shall be as a watered garden, and as a well 
of water whose waters fail not.</p>

and are <i>frequently</i> <i>hypocritical</i>; but to feel true repentance is far more difficult, and consequently 
far less common. Men will attend to the most multiplied and minute 
ceremonial regulations—for such things are <i>pleasing to the flesh</i>—but true religion is too humbling, too heart-searching, too thorough 
for the tastes of the carnal men; they prefer something more ostentatious, 
flimsy, and worldly. Outward observances are <i>temporarily</i> <i>comfortable</i>; eye and ear are pleased; self-conceit is fed, and self-righteousness 
is puffed up: but they are <i>ultimately</i> <i>delusive</i>, for in the article of death, and at the day of judgment, the soul 
needs something more substantial than ceremonies and rituals to lean 
upon. Apart from vital godliness all religion is utterly vain; offered

<p class="normal" id="d1218am-p4"><span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1218am-p4.1">Heart-rending</span>  is <i>divinely wrought and solemnly felt</i>. It is a secret grief which is <i>personally experienced</i>, not in mere form, but as a deep, soul-moving work of the Holy Spirit 
upon the inmost heart of each believer. It is not a matter to be merely 
talked of and believed in, but keenly and sensitively felt in every 
living child of the living God. It is <i>powerfully</i> <i>humiliating</i>, and completely sin-purging; but then it is <i>sweetly preparative</i> for those gracious consolations which proud unhumbled spirits are 
unable to receive; and it is <i>distinctly discriminating</i>, for it belongs to the elect of God, and to them alone.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1218am-p5">The text commands us to rend our hearts, but they are naturally hard

a dying Saviour’s voice rent the rocks once, and it is as powerful now. O blessed 
Spirit, let us hear the death-cries of Jesus, and our hearts shall 
be rent even as men rend their vestures in the day of lamentation.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1218pm-p3">Every wise merchant will occasionally hold a stock-taking, when he 
will cast up his accounts, examine what he has on hand, and ascertain 
decisively whether his trade is prosperous or declining. Every man 
who is wise in the kingdom of heaven, will cry, “Search me, O God, and try me”; and he will frequently set apart special seasons for self-examination, 
to discover whether things are right between God and his soul. The 
God whom we worship is a great heart-searcher; and of old his servants 
knew him as “the Lord which searcheth the heart and trieth the reins of the children 
of men.” Let me stir you up in his name to make diligent search and solemn 
trial of your state, lest you come short of the promised rest. That 
which every wise man does, that which God himself does with us all, 
I exhort you to do with yourself this evening. Let the oldest saint 
look well to the fundamentals of his piety, for grey heads may cover 
black hearts: and let not the young professor despise the word of 
warning, for the greenness of youth may be joined to the rottenness 
of hypocrisy. Every now and then a cedar falls into our midst. The 
enemy still continues to sow tares among the wheat. It is not my aim 
to introduce doubts and fears into your mind; nay, verily, but I shall 
hope the rather that the rough wind of self-examination may help to 
drive them away. It is not security, but carnal security, which we 
would kill; not confidence, but fleshly confidence, which we would 
overthrow; not peace, but false peace, which we would destroy. By 
the precious blood of Christ, which was not shed to make you a hypocrite, 
but that sincere souls might show forth his praise, I beseech you, 
search and look, lest at the last it be said of you, “Mene, Mene, Tekel: thou art weighed in the balances, and art found 
wanting.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1219am-p3">If the disposal of the lot is the Lord’s whose is the arrangement of our whole life? If the simple casting 
of a lot is guided by him, how much more the events of our entire 
life—especially when we are told by our blessed Saviour: “The very hairs of your head are all numbered: not a sparrow falleth 
to the ground without your Father.” It would bring a holy calm over your mind, dear friend, if you were 
always to remember this. It would so relieve your mind from anxiety, 
that you would be the better able to walk in patience, quiet, and 
cheerfulness as a Christian should. When a man is anxious he cannot 
pray with faith; when he is troubled about the world, he cannot serve 
his Master, his thoughts are serving himself. If you would “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,” all things would then be added unto you. You are meddling with Christ’s business, and neglecting your own when you fret about your lot and 
circumstances. You have been trying “providing” work and forgetting that it is yours to obey. Be wise and attend 
to the obeying, and let Christ manage the providing. Come and survey 
your Father’s storehouse, and ask whether he will let you starve while he has 
laid up so great an abundance in his garner? Look at his heart of 
mercy; see if that can ever prove unkind! Look at his inscrutable 
wisdom; see if that will ever be at fault. Above all, look up to Jesus 
Christ your Intercessor, and ask yourself, while he pleads, can your 
Father deal ungraciously with you? If he remembers even sparrows, 
will he forget one of the least of his poor children? “Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee. He will never 
suffer the righteous to be moved.”</p>

ocean: the new heavens and the new earth are none the fairer to our 
imagination, if, indeed, literally there is to be no great and wide 
sea, with its gleaming waves and shelly shores. Is not the text to 
be read as a metaphor, tinged with the prejudice with which the Oriental 
mind universally regarded the sea in the olden times? A real physical 
world without a sea it is mournful to imagine, it would be an iron 
ring without the sapphire which made it precious. There must be a 
spiritual meaning here. In the new dispensation there will be no <i>division</i>—the sea separates nations and sunders peoples from each other. To 
John in Patmos the deep waters were like prison walls, shutting him 
out from his brethren and his work: there shall be no such barriers 
in the world to come. Leagues of rolling billows lie between us and 
many a kinsman whom tonight we prayerfully remember, but in the bright 
world to which we go there shall be unbroken fellowship for all the 
redeemed family. In this sense there shall be no more sea. The sea 
is the emblem of change; with its ebbs and flows, its glassy smoothness 
and its mountainous billows, its gentle murmurs and its tumultuous 
roarings, it is never long the same. Slave of the fickle winds and 
the changeful moon, its instability is proverbial. In this mortal 
state we have too much of this; earth is constant only in her inconstancy, 
but in the heavenly state all mournful change shall be unknown, and 
with it all fear of <i>storm</i> to wreck our hopes and drown our joys. The sea of glass glows with 
a glory unbroken by a wave. No tempest howls along the peaceful shores 
of paradise. Soon shall we reach that happy land where partings, and 
changes, and storms shall be ended! Jesus will waft us there. Are 
we in him or not? This is the grand question.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1220am-p3">Sometimes the Lord Jesus tells his Church his love thoughts. “He does not think it enough behind her back to tell it, but in her 
very presence he says, ‘Thou art all fair, my love.’ It is true, this is not his ordinary method; he is a wise lover, 
and knows when to keep back the intimation of love and when to let 
it out; but there are times when he will make no secret of it; times 
when he will put it beyond all dispute in the souls of his people” (R. Erskine’s Sermons). The Holy Spirit is often pleased, in a most gracious manner, 
to witness with our spirits of the love of Jesus. He takes of the 
things of Christ and reveals them unto us. No voice is heard from 
the clouds, and no vision is seen in the night, but we have a testimony 
more sure than either of these. If an angel should fly from heaven 
and inform the saint personally of the Saviour’s love to him, the evidence would not be one whit more satisfactory 
than that which is borne in the heart by the Holy Ghost. Ask those 
of the Lord’s people who have lived the nearest to the gates of heaven, and they 
will tell you that they have had seasons when the love of Christ towards 
them has been a fact so clear and sure, that they could no more doubt 
it than they could question their own existence. Yes, beloved believer, 
you and I have had times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, 
and then our faith has mounted to the topmost heights of assurance. 
We have had confidence to lean our heads upon the bosom of our Lord, 
and we have no more questioned our Master’s affection to us than John did when in that blessed posture; nay, 
nor so much: for the dark question, “Lord, is it I that shall betray thee?” has been put far from us. He has kissed us with the kisses of his mouth, and killed our doubts 
by the closeness of his embrace. His love has been sweeter than wine 
to our souls.</p>

Oh, how sweet is that sentence, “Enter thou into <i>the joy of thy Lord</i>!” Do you know what the joy of Christ is over a saved sinner? This is 
the very joy which we are to possess in heaven. Yes, when he mounts 
the throne, you shall mount with him. When the heavens ring with “Well done, well done,” you shall partake in the reward; you have toiled with him, you have 
suffered with him, you shall now reign with him; you have sown with 
him, you shall reap with him; your face was covered with sweat like 
his, and your soul was grieved for the sins of men as his soul was, 
now shall your face be bright with heaven’s splendour as is his countenance, and now shall your soul be filled 
with beatific joys even as his soul is.</p>

Stop, my soul. God, the everlasting Father, has positively made 
a covenant with thee; yes, that God who spake the world into existence 
by a word; he, stooping from his majesty, takes hold of thy hand and 
makes a covenant with thee. Is it not a deed, the stupendous condescension 
of which might ravish our hearts forever if we could really understand 
it? “HE hath made with me a covenant.” A king has not made a covenant with me—that were somewhat; but the Prince of the kings of the earth, Shaddai, 
the Lord All-sufficient, the Jehovah of ages, the everlasting Elohim, 
“He hath made with me an everlasting covenant.” But notice, it is <i>particular in its application</i>. “Yet hath he made with <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1221am-p3.3">me</span>  an everlasting covenant.” Here lies the sweetness of it to each believer. It is nought for 
me that he made peace for the world; I want to know whether he made 
peace for <i>me</i>! It is little that he hath made a covenant, I want to know whether 
he has made a covenant <i>with me</i>. Blessed is the assurance that he hath made a covenant with me! If 
God the Holy Ghost gives me assurance of this, then his salvation 
is mine, his heart is mine, he himself is mine—<i>he is my God</i>.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1221am-p4">This covenant is <i>everlasting in its duration</i>. An everlasting covenant means a covenant which had no beginning, 
and which shall never, never end. How sweet amidst all the uncertainties 
of life, to know that “the foundation of the Lord standeth sure,” and to have God’s own promise, “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out 
of my lips.” Like dying David, I will sing of this, even though my house be not 
so with God as my heart desireth.</p>

an unrivalled <i>broidered work</i>, in which every attribute takes its part and every divine beauty 
is revealed. No art like the art displayed in our salvation, no cunning 
workmanship like that beheld in the righteousness of the saints. Justification 
has engrossed learned pens in all ages of the church, and will be 
the theme of admiration in eternity. God has indeed “curiously wrought it.” With all this elaboration there is mingled utility and durability, 
comparable to our being <i>shod with badgers’ skins</i>. The animal here meant is unknown, but its skin covered the tabernacle, 
and formed one of the finest and strongest leathers known. The righteousness 
which is of God by faith endureth forever, and he who is shod with 
this divine preparation will tread the desert safely, and may even 
set his foot upon the lion and the adder. Purity and dignity of our 
holy vesture are brought out in <i>the fine linen</i>. When the Lord sanctifies his people, they are clad as priests in 
pure white; not the snow itself excels them; they are in the eyes 
of men and angels fair to look upon, and even in the Lord’s eyes they are without spot. Meanwhile the royal apparel is delicate

promised to supply thee with daily strength. While he is able to uphold 
the universe, dream not that he will prove unable to fulfil his own

Remember how he spake and it was done; how he commanded, and it stood 
fast. Shall he that created the world grow weary? He hangeth the world 
upon nothing; shall he who doth this be unable to support his children? 
Shall he be unfaithful to his word for want of power? Who is it that 
restrains the tempest? Doth not he ride upon the wings of the wind, 
and make the clouds his chariots, and hold the ocean in the hollow 
of his hand? How can he fail thee? When he has put such a faithful

<p class="normal" id="d1222pm-p3">What is the secret spot which infallibly betokens the child of God? 
It were vain presumption to decide this upon our own judgment; but 
God’s word reveals it to us, and we may tread surely where we have revelation 
to be our guide. Now, we are told concerning our Lord, “to as many as <i>received him</i>, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to as many 
as believed on his name.” Then, if I have received Christ Jesus into my heart, I am a child 
of God. That reception is described in the same verse as <i>believing on the name of Jesus Christ</i>. If, then, I believe on Jesus Christ’s name—that is, simply from my heart trust myself with the crucified, but 
now exalted, Redeemer, I am a member of the family of the Most High. 
Whatever else I may not have, if I have this, I have the privilege 
to become a child of God. Our Lord Jesus puts it in another shape. 
“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” Here is the matter in a nutshell. Christ appears as a shepherd to 
his own sheep, not to others. As soon as he appears, his own sheep 
perceive him—they trust him, they are prepared to follow him; he knows them, and 
they know him—there is a mutual knowledge—there is a constant connection between them. Thus the one mark, the 
sure mark, the infallible mark of regeneration and adoption is a hearty 
faith in the appointed Redeemer. Reader, are you in doubt, are you 
uncertain whether you bear the secret mark of God’s children? Then let not an hour pass over your head till you have 
said, “Search me, O God, and know my heart.” Trifle not here, I adjure you! If you must trifle anywhere, let it 
be about some secondary matter: your health, if you will, or the title 
deeds of your estate; but about your soul, your never-dying soul and 
its eternal destinies, I beseech you to be in earnest. Make sure work 
for eternity.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1223am-p3">When first the life of grace begins in the soul, we do indeed draw 
near to God, but it is with great fear and trembling. The soul conscious 
of guilt, and humbled thereby, is overawed with the solemnity of its 
position; it is cast to the earth by a sense of the grandeur of Jehovah, 
in whose presence it stands. With unfeigned bashfulness it takes the 
lowest room.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1223am-p4">But, in after life, as the Christian grows in grace, although he will 
never forget the solemnity of his position, and will never lose that 
holy awe which must encompass a gracious man when he is in the presence 
of the God who can create or can destroy; yet his fear has all its 
terror taken out of it; it becomes a holy reverence, and no more an 
overshadowing dread. He is called up higher, to greater access to 
God in Christ Jesus. Then the man of God, walking amid the splendours 
of Deity, and veiling his face like the glorious cherubim, with those 
twin wings, the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ, will, reverent 
and bowed in spirit, approach the throne; and seeing there a God of 
love, of goodness, and of mercy, he will realize rather the covenant 
character of God than his absolute Deity. He will see in God rather 
his goodness than his greatness, and more of his love than of his 
majesty. Then will the soul, bowing still as humbly as aforetime, 
enjoy a more sacred liberty of intercession; for while prostrate before 
the glory of the Infinite God, it will be sustained by the refreshing 
consciousness of being in the presence of boundless mercy and infinite 
love, and by the realization of acceptance “in the Beloved.” Thus the believer is bidden to come up higher, and is enabled to 
exercise the privilege of rejoicing in God, and drawing near to him 
in holy confidence, saying, “Abba, Father.”</p>

unless of his substance he ministers to their necessities, so (the 
same rule holding with the head as between the members), it is impossible 
that our Divine Lord could have had fellowship with us unless he had 
imparted to us of his own abounding wealth, and had become poor to 
make us rich. Had he remained upon his throne of glory, and had we 
continued in the ruins of the fall without receiving his salvation, 
communion would have been impossible on both sides. Our position by 
the fall, apart from the covenant of grace, made it as impossible 
for fallen man to communicate with God as it is for Belial to be in 
concord with Christ. In order, therefore, that communion might be 
compassed, it was necessary that the rich kinsman should bestow his 
estate upon his poor relatives, that the righteous Saviour should 
give to his sinning brethren of his own perfection, and that we, the 
poor and guilty, should receive of his fulness grace for grace; that 
thus in giving and receiving, the One might descend from the heights, 
and the other ascend from the depths, and so be able to embrace each 
other in true and hearty fellowship. Poverty must be enriched by him 
in whom are infinite treasures before it can venture to commune; and 
guilt must lose itself in imputed and imparted righteousness ere the 
soul can walk in fellowship with purity. Jesus must clothe his people 
in his own garments, or he cannot admit them into his palace of glory; 
and he must wash them in his own blood, or else they will be too defiled 
for the embrace of his fellowship.</p>

we by faith can claim an interest in him, and can sing, “<i>Unto us</i> a child is born, <i>unto us</i> a son is given.” Jesus is Jehovah incarnate, our Lord and our God, and yet our brother 
and friend; let us adore and admire. Let us notice at the very first 
glance <i>his miraculous conception</i>. It was a thing unheard of before, and unparalleled since, that a 
virgin should conceive and bear a Son. The first promise ran thus, 
“<i>The seed of the woman</i>,” not the offspring of the man. Since venturous woman led the way in 
the sin which brought forth Paradise lost, she, and she alone, ushers 
in the Regainer of Paradise. Our Saviour, although truly man, was 
as to his human nature the Holy One of God. Let us reverently bow 
before the holy Child whose innocence restores to manhood its ancient 
glory; and let us pray that he may be formed in us, the hope of glory. 
Fail not to note <i>his humble parentage</i>. His mother has been described simply as “a virgin,” not a princess, or prophetess, nor a matron of large estate. True 
the blood of kings ran in her veins; nor was her mind a weak and untaught 
one, for she could sing most sweetly a song of praise; but yet how 
humble her position, how poor the man to whom she stood affianced, 
and how miserable the accommodation afforded to the new-born King!</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1225pm-p3">What the patriarch did early in the morning, after the family festivities, 
it will be well for the believer to do for himself ere he rests tonight. 
Amid the cheerfulness of household gatherings it is easy to slide 
into sinful levities, and to forget our avowed character as Christians. 
It ought not to be so, but so it is, that our days of feasting are 
very seldom days of sanctified enjoyment, but too frequently degenerate 
into unhallowed mirth. There is a way of joy as pure and sanctifying 
as though one bathed in the rivers of Eden: holy gratitude should 
be quite as purifying an element as grief. Alas! for our poor hearts, 
that facts prove that the house of mourning is better than the house 
of feasting. Come, believer, in what have you sinned today? Have you 
been forgetful of your high calling? Have you been even as others 
in idle words and loose speeches? Then confess the sin, and fly to 
the sacrifice. The sacrifice sanctifies. The precious blood of the 
Lamb slain removes the guilt, and purges away the defilement of our 
sins of ignorance and carelessness. This is the best ending of a Christmas-day—to wash anew in the cleansing fountain. Believer, come to this sacrifice 
continually; if it be so good tonight, it is good every night. To 
live at the altar is the privilege of the royal priesthood; to them 
sin, great as it is, is nevertheless no cause for despair, since they 
draw near yet again to the sin-atoning victim, and their conscience 
is purged from dead works.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1226am-p3">Jesus is the federal head of his elect. As in Adam, every heir of 
flesh and blood has a personal interest, because he is the covenant 
head and representative of the race as considered under the law of 
works; so under the law of grace, every redeemed soul is one with 
the Lord from heaven, since he is the Second Adam, the Sponsor and 
Substitute of the elect in the new covenant of love. The apostle Paul 
declares that Levi was in the loins of Abraham when Melchizedek met 
him: it is a certain truth that the believer was in the loins of Jesus 
Christ, the Mediator, when in old eternity the covenant settlements 
of grace were decreed, ratified, and made sure forever. Thus, whatever 
Christ hath done, he hath wrought for the whole body of his Church. 
We were crucified in him and buried with him (read <scripRef passage="Col 2:10-13" id="d1226am-p3.1" parsed="|Col|2|10|2|13" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.10-13">Col. 2:10-13</scripRef>), and to make it still more wonderful, we are risen with him and 
even ascended with him to the seats on high (<scripRef passage="Eph 2:6" id="d1226am-p3.2" parsed="|Eph|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.6">Eph. 2:6</scripRef>). It is thus that the Church has fulfilled the law, and is “accepted <i>in the beloved</i>.” It is thus that she is regarded with complacency by the just Jehovah, 
for he views her in Jesus, and does not look upon her as separate 
from her covenant head. As the Anointed Redeemer of Israel, Christ 
Jesus has nothing distinct from his Church, but all that he has he 
holds for her. Adam’s righteousness was ours so long as he maintained it, and his sin 
was ours the moment that he committed it; and in the same manner, 
all that the Second Adam is or does, is ours as well as his, seeing 
that he is our representative. Here is the foundation of the covenant 
of grace. This gracious system of representation and substitution, 
which moved Justin Martyr to cry out, “O blessed change, O sweet permutation!” this is the very groundwork of the gospel of our salvation, and is 
to be received with strong faith and rapturous joy.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1226pm-p3">The Lord Jesus is in the midst of his church; he walketh among the 
golden candlesticks; his promise is, “Lo, I am with you alway.” He is as surely with us now as he was with the disciples at the lake, 
when they saw coals of fire, and fish laid thereon and bread. Not 
carnally, but still in real truth, Jesus is with us. And a blessed 
truth it is, for where Jesus is, <i>love becomes inflamed</i>. Of all the things in the world that can set the heart burning, there 
is nothing like the presence of Jesus! A glimpse of him so overcomes 
us, that we are ready to say, “Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me.” Even the smell of the aloes, and the myrrh, and the cassia, which 
drop from his perfumed garments, causes the sick and the faint to 
grow strong. Let there be but a moment’s leaning of the head upon that gracious bosom, and a reception of 
his divine love into our poor cold hearts, and we are cold no longer, 
but glow like seraphs, equal to every labour, and capable of every 
suffering. If we know that Jesus is with us, <i>every power will</i> <i>be developed</i>, and every grace will be strengthened, and we shall cast ourselves 
into the Lord’s service with heart, and soul, and strength; therefore is the presence 
of Christ to be desired above all things. <i>His presence will be most realized</i> <i>by those who are most like him</i>. If you desire to see Christ, you must grow in conformity to him. 
Bring yourself, by the power of the Spirit, into union with Christ’s desires, and motives, and plans of action, and you are likely to 
be favoured with his company. Remember <i>his presence may be had</i>. His promise is as true as ever. He delights to be with us. If he 
doth not come, it is because we hinder him by our indifference. He 
will reveal himself to our earnest prayers, and graciously suffer 
himself to be detained by our entreaties, and by our tears, for these 
are the golden chains which bind Jesus to his people.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1227am-p3">The rush is spongy and hollow, and even so is a hypocrite; there is 
no substance or stability in him. It is shaken to and fro in every 
wind just as formalists yield to every influence; for this reason 
the rush is not broken by the tempest, neither are hypocrites troubled 
with persecution. I would not willingly be a deceiver or be deceived; 
perhaps the text for this day may help me to try myself whether I 
be a hypocrite or no. The rush by nature lives in water, and owes 
its very existence to the mire and moisture wherein it has taken root; 
let the mire become dry, and the rush withers very quickly. Its greenness 
is absolutely dependent upon circumstances, a present abundance of 
water makes it flourish, and a drought destroys it at once. Is this 
my case? Do I only serve God when I am in good company, or when religion 
is profitable and respectable? Do I love the Lord only when temporal 
comforts are received from his hands? If so I am a base hypocrite, 
and like the withering rush, I shall perish when death deprives me 
of outward joys. But can I honestly assert that when bodily comforts 
have been few, and my surroundings have been rather adverse to grace 
than at all helpful to it, I have still held fast my integrity? Then 
have I hope that there is genuine vital godliness in me. The rush 
cannot grow without mire, but plants of the Lord’s right hand planting can and do flourish even in the year of drought. 
A godly man often grows best when his worldly circumstances decay. 
He who follows Christ for his bag is a Judas; they who follow for 
loaves and fishes are children of the devil; but they who attend him 
out of love to himself are his own beloved ones. Lord, let me find 
my life in <i>thee</i>, and not in the mire of this world’s favour or gain.</p>

before his people, an angel should go before them to lead them in 
the way; but Moses said, “If <i>thy</i> presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.” Christian, God has not left you in your earthly pilgrimage to an 
angel’s guidance: he himself leads the van. You may not see the cloudy, 
fiery pillar, but Jehovah will never forsake you. Notice the word 
<i>shall</i>—“The Lord shall guide thee.” How certain this makes it! How sure it is that God will not forsake 
us! His precious “shalls” and “wills” are better than men’s oaths. “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” Then observe the adverb <i>continually</i>. We are not merely to be guided sometimes, but we are to have a perpetual 
monitor; not occasionally to be left to our own understanding, and 
so to wander, but we are continually to hear the guiding voice of 
the Great Shepherd; and if we follow close at his heels, we shall 
not err, but be led by a right way to a city to dwell in. If you have 
to change your position in life; if you have to emigrate to distant 
shores; if it should happen that you are cast into poverty, or uplifted 
suddenly into a more responsible position than the one you now occupy; 
if you are thrown among strangers, or cast among foes, yet tremble 
not, for “the Lord shall guide thee continually.” There are no dilemmas out of which you shall not be delivered if 
you live near to God, and your heart be kept warm with holy love. 
He goes not amiss who goes in the company of God. Like Enoch, walk 
with God, and you cannot mistake your road. You have infallible wisdom 
to direct you, immutable love to comfort you, and eternal power to 
defend you. “Jehovah”—mark the word—“Jehovah shall guide thee continually.”</p>

of all said, “Live;” and this he did <i>first</i>, because life is one of the absolutely essential things in spiritual 
matters, and until it be bestowed we are incapable of partaking in 
the things of the kingdom. Now the life which grace confers upon the 
saints at the moment of their quickening is none other than the life 
of Christ, which, like the sap from the stem, runs into us, the branches, 
and establishes a living connection between our souls and Jesus. Faith 
is the grace which perceives this union, having proceeded from it 
as its firstfruit. It is the neck which joins the body of the Church 
to its all-glorious Head.</p>

She knows his excellence and worth, and no temptation can induce her 
to repose her trust elsewhere; and Christ Jesus is so delighted with 
this heavenly grace, that he never ceases to strengthen and sustain 
her by the loving embrace and all-sufficient support of his eternal 
arms. Here, then, is established a living, sensible, and delightful 
union which casts forth streams of love, confidence, sympathy, complacency, 
and joy, whereof both the bride and bridegroom love to drink. When 
the soul can evidently perceive this oneness between itself and Christ, 
the pulse may be felt as beating for both, and the one blood as flowing 
through the veins of each. Then is the heart as near heaven as it 
can be on earth, and is prepared for the enjoyment of the most sublime 
and spiritual kind of fellowship.</p>

objects to make none; but if to do the right, and to believe the true, 
should cause him to lose every earthly friend, he will count it but 
a small loss, since his great Friend in heaven will be yet more friendly, 
and reveal himself to him more graciously than ever. O ye who have 
taken up his cross, know ye not what your Master said? “I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter 
against her mother; and a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.” Christ is the great Peacemaker; but before peace, he brings war. 
Where the light cometh, the darkness must retire. Where truth is, 
the lie must flee; or, if it abideth, there must be a stern conflict, 
for the truth cannot and will not lower its standard, and the lie 
must be trodden under foot. If you follow Christ, you shall have all 
the dogs of the world yelping at your heels. If you would live so 
as to stand the test of the last tribunal, depend upon it the world 
will not speak well of you. He who has the friendship of the world 
is an enemy to God; but if you are true and faithful to the Most High, 
men will resent your unflinching fidelity, since it is a testimony 
against their iniquities. Fearless of all consequences, you must do 
the right. You will need the courage of a lion unhesitatingly to pursue 
a course which shall turn your best friend into your fiercest foe; 
but for the love of Jesus you must thus be courageous. For the truth’s sake to hazard reputation and affection, is such a deed that to 
do it constantly you will need a degree of moral principle which only 
the Spirit of God can work in you; yet turn not your back like a coward, 
but play the man. Follow right manfully in your Master’s steps, for he has traversed this rough way before you. Better a 
brief warfare and eternal rest, than false peace and everlasting torment.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1229pm-p3">The great test of your soul’s health is, <i>What think you of</i> <i>Christ</i>? Is he to you “fairer than the children of men”—“the chief among ten thousand”—the “altogether lovely”? Wherever Christ is thus esteemed, all the faculties of the spiritual 
man exercise themselves with energy. I will judge of your piety by 
this barometer: does Christ stand high or low with you? If you have 
thought little of Christ, if you have been content to live without 
his presence, if you have cared little for his honour, if you have 
been neglectful of his laws, then I know that your soul is sick—God grant that it may not be sick unto death! But if the first thought 
of your spirit has been, how can I honour Jesus? If the daily desire 
of your soul has been, “O that I knew where I might find him!” I tell you that you may have a thousand infirmities, and even scarcely 
know whether you are a child of God at all, and yet I am persuaded, 
beyond a doubt, that you are safe, since Jesus is great in your esteem. 
I care not for thy rags, what thinkest thou of <i>his</i> royal apparel? I care not for thy wounds, though they bleed in torrents, 
what thinkest thou of <i>his</i> wounds? are they like glittering rubies in thine esteem? I think 
none the less of thee, though thou liest like Lazarus on the dunghill, 
and the dogs do lick thee—I judge thee not by thy poverty: what thinkest thou of the King in 
his beauty? Has he a glorious high throne in thy heart? Wouldest thou 
set him higher if thou couldest? Wouldest thou be willing to die if 
thou couldest but add another trumpet to the strain which proclaims 
his praise? Ah! then it is well with thee. Whatever thou mayest think 
of thyself, if Christ be great to thee, thou shalt be with him ere 
long.</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1230am-p3">Look at David’s Lord and Master; see his beginning. He was despised and rejected 
of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Would you see 
the end? He sits at his Father’s right hand, expecting until his enemies be made his footstool. “As he is, so are we also in this world.” You must bear the cross, or you shall never wear the crown; you must 
wade through the mire, or you shall never walk the golden pavement. 
Cheer up, then, poor Christian. “Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.” See that creeping worm, how contemptible its appearance! It is the 
beginning of a thing. Mark that insect with gorgeous wings, playing 
in the sunbeams, sipping at the flower bells, full of happiness and 
life; that is the end thereof. That caterpillar is yourself, until 
you are wrapped up in the chrysalis of death; but when Christ shall 
appear you shall be like him, for you shall see him as he is. Be content 
to be like him, a worm and no man, that like him you may be satisfied 
when you wake up in his likeness. That rough-looking diamond is put 
upon the wheel of the lapidary. He cuts it on all sides. It loses 
much—much that seemed costly to itself. The king is crowned; the diadem 
is put upon the monarch’s head with trumpet’s joyful sound. A glittering ray flashes from that coronet, and it 
beams from that very diamond which was just now so sorely vexed by 
the lapidary. You may venture to compare yourself to such a diamond, 
for you are one of God’s people; and this is the time of the cutting process. Let faith and 
patience have their perfect work, for in the day when the crown shall 
be set upon the head of the King, Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, one 
ray of glory shall stream from you. “They shall be mine,” saith the Lord, “in the day when I make up my jewels.” “Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.”</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1230pm-p3">If, O my reader! thou art merely a professor, and not a possessor 
of the faith that is in Christ Jesus, the following lines are a true 
sketch of thine end.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1230pm-p4">You are a respectable attendant at a place of worship; you go because 
others go, not because your heart is right with God. This is your 
beginning. I will suppose that for the next twenty or thirty years 
you will be spared to go on as you do now, professing religion by 
an outward attendance upon the means of grace, but having no heart 
in the matter. Tread softly, for I must show you the deathbed of such 
a one as yourself. Let us gaze upon him gently. A clammy sweat is 
on his brow, and he wakes up crying, “O God, it is hard to die. Did you send for my minister?” “Yes, he is coming.” The minister comes. “Sir, I fear that I am dying!” “Have you any hope?” “I cannot say that I have. I fear to stand before my God; oh! pray 
for me.” The prayer is offered for him with sincere earnestness, and the way 
of salvation is for the ten-thousandth time put before him, but before 
he has grasped the rope, I see him sink. I may put my finger upon 
those cold eyelids, for they will never see anything here again. But 
where is the man, and where are the man’s true eyes? It is written, “In hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.” Ah! why did he not lift up his eyes before? Because he was so accustomed 
to hear the gospel that his soul slept under it. Alas! if you should 
lift up your eyes there, how bitter will be your wailings. Let the 
Saviour’s own words reveal the woe: “Father Abraham, send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger 
in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.” There is a frightful meaning in those words. May you never have to 
spell it out by the red light of Jehovah’s wrath!</p>

saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.”</i></p>

<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p3"><i>Patience had her perfect work</i> in the Lord Jesus, and until the last day of the feast he pleaded 
with the Jews, even as on this last day of the year he pleads with 
us, and waits to be gracious to us. Admirable indeed is the longsuffering 
of the Saviour in bearing with some of us year after year, notwithstanding 
our provocations, rebellions, and resistance of his Holy Spirit. Wonder 
of wonders that we are still in the land of mercy!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p4"><i>Pity expressed herself most plainly</i>, for Jesus <i>cried</i>, which implies not only the loudness of his voice, but the tenderness 
of his tones. He entreats us to be reconciled. “We <i>pray</i> you,” says the Apostle, “as though God did <i>beseech</i> you by us.” What earnest, pathetic terms are these! How deep must be the love 
which makes the Lord weep over sinners, and like a mother woo his 
children to his bosom! Surely at the call of such a cry our willing 
hearts will come.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p5"><i>Provision is made most plenteously</i>; all is provided that man can need to quench his soul’s thirst. To his conscience the atonement brings peace; to his understanding 
the gospel brings the richest instruction; to his heart the person 
of Jesus is the noblest object of affection; to the whole man the 
truth as it is in Jesus supplies the purest nutriment. Thirst is terrible, 
but Jesus can remove it. Though the soul were utterly famished, Jesus 
could restore it.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p6"><i>Proclamation is made most freely</i>, that every thirsty one is welcome. No other distinction is made 
but that of thirst. Whether it be the thirst of avarice, ambition, 
pleasure, knowledge, or rest, he who suffers from it is invited. The 
thirst may be bad in itself, and be no sign of grace, but rather a 
mark of inordinate sin longing to be gratified with deeper draughts 
of lust; but it is not goodness in the creature which brings him the 
invitation, the Lord Jesus sends it freely, and without respect of 
persons.</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p7"><i>Personality is declared most fully</i>. The sinner must come to Jesus, not to works, ordinances, or doctrines, 
but to a personal Redeemer, who his own self bare our sins in his 
own body on the tree. The bleeding, dying, rising Saviour, is the 
only star of hope to a sinner. Oh for grace to come now and drink, 
ere the sun sets upon the year’s last day!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231am-p8">No waiting or preparation is so much as hinted at. Drinking represents 
a reception for which no fitness is required. A fool, a thief, a harlot 
can drink; and so sinfulness of character is no bar to the invitation 
to believe in Jesus. We want no golden cup, no bejewelled chalice, 
in which to convey the water to the thirsty; the mouth of poverty 
is welcome to stoop down and quaff the flowing flood. Blistered, leprous, 
filthy lips may touch the stream of divine love; they cannot pollute 
it, but shall themselves be purified. Jesus is the fount of hope. 
Dear reader, hear the dear Redeemer’s loving voice as he cries to each of us,</p>

<p class="normal" id="d1231pm-p3">Not <i>saved</i>! Dear reader, is this your mournful plight? Warned of the judgment 
to come, bidden to escape for your life, and yet at this moment <i>not saved</i>! You know the way of salvation, you read it in the Bible, you hear 
it from the pulpit, it is explained to you by friends, and yet you 
neglect it, and therefore you are <i>not saved</i>. You will be without excuse when the Lord shall judge the quick and 
dead. The Holy Spirit has given more or less of blessing upon the 
word which has been preached in your hearing, and times of refreshing 
have come from the divine presence, and yet you are without Christ. 
All these hopeful seasons have come and gone—your summer and your harvest have past—and yet you are <i>not saved</i>. Years have followed one another into eternity, and your last year 
will soon be here: youth has gone, manhood is going, and yet you are 
<i>not saved</i>. Let me ask you—<i>will you ever be saved</i>? Is there any likelihood of it? Already the most propitious seasons 
have left you unsaved; will other occasions alter your condition? 
Means have failed with you—the best of means, used perseveringly and with the utmost affection—what more can be done for you? Affliction and prosperity have alike 
failed to impress you; tears and prayers and sermons have been wasted 
on your barren heart. Are not the probabilities dead against your 
ever being saved? Is it not more than likely that you will abide as 
you are till death forever bars the door of hope? Do you recoil from 
the supposition? Yet it is a most reasonable one: he who is not washed 
in so many waters will in all probability go filthy to his end. The 
convenient time never has come, why should it ever come? It is logical 
to fear that it never will arrive, and that Felix like, you will find 
no convenient season till you are in hell. O bethink you of what that 
hell is, and of the dread probability that you will soon be cast into 
it!</p>
<p class="normal" id="d1231pm-p4">Reader, suppose you should die unsaved, your doom no words can picture. 
Write out your dread estate in tears and blood, talk of it with groans 
and gnashing of teeth: you will be punished with everlasting destruction 
from the glory of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. A brother’s voice would fain startle you into earnestness. O be wise, be wise 
in time, and ere another year begins, believe in Jesus, who is able 
to save to the uttermost. Consecrate these last hours to lonely thought, 
and if deep repentance be bred in you, it will be well; and if it 
lead to a humble faith in Jesus, it will be best of all. O see to 
it that this year pass not away, and you an unforgiven spirit. Let 
not the new year’s midnight peals sound upon a joyless spirit! Now, <span style="font-variant:small-caps" id="d1231pm-p4.1">now</span>, NOW believe, and live.</p>
